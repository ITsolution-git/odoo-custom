class ir_needaction_mixin(osv.Model):
    '''Mixin class for objects using the need action feature.

    Need action feature can be used by objects having to be able to
    signal that an action is required on a particular record. If in
    the business logic an action must be performed by somebody, for
    instance validation by a manager, this mechanism allows to set a
    list of users asked to perform an action.

    Objects using the 'need_action' feature should override the
    ``needaction_domain_get`` method. This methods returns a
    domain to filter records requiring an action for a specific user.

    This class also offers several global services:
    - ``needaction_get_action_count``: as ``needaction_get_record_ids``
    but returns only the number of action, not the ids (performs a
    search with count=True)

class ir_needaction_mixin(osv.Model):
    '''Mixin class for objects using the need action feature.
    
    Need action feature can be used by objects willing to be able to
    signal that an action is required on a particular record. If in the
    business logic an action must be performed by somebody, for instance
    validation by a manager, this mechanism allows to set a list of
    users asked to perform an action.
    
    This class wraps a class (ir.ir_needaction_users_rel) that behaves
    like a many2many field. However, no field is added to the model
    inheriting from this mixin class. This class handles the low-level
    considerations of updating relationships. Every change made on the
    record calls a method that updates the relationships.
    
    Objects using the 'need_action' feature should override the
    ``get_needaction_user_ids`` method. This methods returns a dictionary
    whose keys are record ids, and values a list of user ids, like
    in a many2many relationship. Therefore by defining only one method,
    you can specify if an action is required by defining the users
    that have to do it, in every possible situation.
    
    This class also offers several global services,:
    - ``needaction_get_record_ids``: for the current model and uid, get
      all record ids that ask this user to perform an action. This
      mechanism is used for instance to display the number of pending
      actions in menus, such as Leads (12)
    - ``needaction_get_action_count``: as ``needaction_get_record_ids``
      but returns only the number of action, not the ids (performs a
      search with count=True)
    - ``needaction_get_user_record_references``: for a given uid, get all
      the records that ask this user to perform an action. Records
      are given as references, a list of tuples (model_name, record_id)

    The ``ir_needaction_mixin`` class adds a function field on models inheriting 
    from the class. This field allows to state whether a given record has 
    a needaction for the current user. This is usefull if you want to customize 
    views according to the needaction feature. For example, you may want to 
    set records in bold in a list view if the current user has an action to 
    perform on the record. This makes the class not a pure abstract class, 
    but allows to easily use the action information.'''

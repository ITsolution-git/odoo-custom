""" Cron jobs scheduling

Cron jobs are defined in the ir_cron table/model. This module deals with all
cron jobs, for all databases of a single OpenERP server instance.

It defines a single master thread that will spawn (a bounded number of)
threads to process individual cron jobs.

The thread runs forever, checking every 60 seconds for new
'database wake-ups'. It maintains a heapq of database wake-ups. At each
wake-up, it will call ir_cron._run_jobs_multithread() for the given database. _run_jobs_multithread
will check the jobs defined in the ir_cron table and spawn accordingly threads
to process them.

This module's behavior depends on the following configuration variable:
openerp.conf.max_cron_threads.

# Heapq of database wake-ups. Note that 'database wake-up' meaning is in
# the context of the cron management. This is not originally about loading
# a database, although having the database name in the queue will
# cause it to be loaded when the schedule time is reached, even if it was
# unloaded in the mean time. Normally a database's wake-up is cancelled by
# the RegistryManager when the database is unloaded - so this should not
# cause it to be reloaded.
#
# TODO: perhaps in the future we could consider a flag on ir.cron jobs
# that would cause database wake-up even if the database has not been
# loaded yet or was already unloaded (e.g. 'force_db_wakeup' or something)
#
# Each element is a triple (timestamp, database-name, boolean). The boolean
# specifies if the wake-up is canceled (so a wake-up can be canceled without
# relying on the heapq implementation detail; no need to remove the job from
# the heapq).

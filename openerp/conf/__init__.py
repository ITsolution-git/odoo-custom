""" Library-wide configuration variables.

For now, configuration code is in openerp.tools.config. It is in mainly
unprocessed form, e.g. addons_path is a string with commas-separated
paths. The aim is to have code related to configuration (command line
parsing, configuration file loading and saving, ...) in this module
and provide real Python variables, e.g. addons_paths is really a list
of paths.

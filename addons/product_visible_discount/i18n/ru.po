"    This module lets you calculate discounts on Sale Order lines and Invoice "
"lines base on the partner's pricelist.\n"
"    To this end, a new check box named \"Visible Discount\" is added to the "
"pricelist form.\n"
"    Example:\n"
"        For the product PC1 and the partner \"Asustek\": if listprice=450, "
"and the price calculated using Asustek's pricelist is 225\n"
"        If the check box is checked, we will have on the sale order line: "
"Unit price=450, Discount=50,00, Net price=225\n"
"        If the check box is unchecked, we will have on Sale Order and "
"Invoice lines: Unit price=225, Discount=0,00, Net price=225\n"

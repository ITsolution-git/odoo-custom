    This module lets you calculate discounts on Sale Order lines and Invoice lines base on the partner's pricelist.
    To this end, a new check box named "Visible Discount" is added to the pricelist form.
    Example:
        For the product PC1 and the partner "Asustek": if listprice=450, and the price calculated using Asustek's pricelist is 225
        If the check box is checked, we will have on the sale order line: Unit price=450, Discount=50,00, Net price=225
        If the check box is unchecked, we will have on Sale Order and Invoice lines: Unit price=225, Discount=0,00, Net price=225

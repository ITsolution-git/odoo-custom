  Now I will test Meetings which may be customer meeting or phonecall meeting or
  internal Meeting.
- |
  I start by creating a new Meeting.     
- 
  !record {model: crm.meeting, id: crm_meeting_regardingpresentation0}:
    categ_id: crm.categ_meet2
    date: '2010-04-21 16:04:00'
    date_deadline: '2010-04-22 00:04:00'
    duration: 8.0
    email_from: info@balmerinc.be
    location: Ahmedabad
    name: Regarding Presentation
    partner_address_id: base.res_partner_address_1
    partner_id: base.res_partner_9
    rrule_type: weekly
    section_id: crm.section_sales_department
- |
  I check that the Meetings is in 'UnConfirmed' state.
-       
  !assert {model: crm.meeting, id: crm_meeting_regardingpresentation0}:
     - state == "draft" 
- |
  I can set reminder on meeting if I put reminder "40 minutes before" 
- |
  For that, I first create alarm.
- 
  !record {model: res.alarm, id: res_alarm_minituesbefore0}:
    name: 40 minutes before
    trigger_duration: 40
    trigger_interval: minutes
    trigger_occurs: before
    trigger_related: start
- |
  Now I will assign this reminder. 
  
- !python {model: crm.meeting}: |
     self.write(cr, uid, [ref('crm_meeting_regardingpresentation0')], {'alarm_id': ref("res_alarm_minituesbefore0")})
- |
  In order to check recurrence on meetings I will set Recurrency to Custom
  and I set the fields so that the meeting will occure weekly on Monday and Friday 10 times
-
  !python {model: crm.meeting}: |
     self.write(cr, uid, [ref("crm_meeting_regardingpresentation0")], {'fr': 1, 'mo': 1, 'th': 1, 'tu': 1, 'we':1,   'count':10, 'interval': 1, 'freq': 'weekly', 'rrule_type': 'custom'})
      
- |
  I can see from the calendar view that the meeting is scheduled on Monday and Friday
  for 10 times,
  
-
  !python {model: crm.meeting}: |
    self.fields_view_get(cr, uid, False, 'calendar', context)
- | 
  I will search for one of the recurrent event and count the number of meeting.
-
  !python {model: crm.meeting}: |
     ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('date', '>=', '2010-04-21 00:00:00'), ('date', '<=', '2010-05-21 00:00:00')] )
     assert len(ids) == 10      

- |
  Now If I want to edit meetings information for all occurence I click on "Edit All" button.
-
  !python {model: crm.meeting}: |
    self.open_meeting(cr, uid, [ref('crm_meeting_regardingpresentation0')])
- |   
  I can see that new meeting form is opened with same value
  I change some data for meeting and save it
  I can see from meeting's calendar view that all meeting occurences are changed accordingly
- 
  !record {model: crm.meeting, id: crm.crm_meeting_regardingpresentation0}:
    alarm_id: base_calendar.alarm9
    rrule_type: weekly

- | 
  In order to invite people for this meetings, I click on "Invite People" button
  I can invite internal user. 
- 
  !record {model: base_calendar.invite.attendee, id: base_calendar_invite_attendee_0}:
    type: internal
    send_mail: False
    partner_id: base.res_partner_9
    user_ids:
      - base.user_demo
-
  I click on "Invite" button of "Invite attendee" wizard.    
-
  !python {model: base_calendar.invite.attendee}: |
    self.do_invite(cr, uid, [ref('base_calendar_invite_attendee_0')], {'active_id': ref('crm_meeting_regardingpresentation0'), 'model' : 'crm.meeting', 'attendee_field':'attendee_ids'}) 

- |
  After direct/indirect confirmation for meetings I can confirm meeting   
-
  !python {model: crm.meeting}: |
    self.case_open(cr, uid, [ref('crm_meeting_regardingpresentation0')])

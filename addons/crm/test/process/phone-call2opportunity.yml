  For customer purpose, I called to him/her for discussion about openerp.
  As the success of phonecall seems to be a real business opportunity, so first i
  create record of phonecall.
-
  !record {model: crm.phonecall2opportunity, id: crm_phonecall2opportunity_disc_openerp}:
    name: Discuss Review Process
    partner_id: base.res_partner_tinyatwork
-
  Succeed phonecall, it's convert into on opportunity.
-
  !python {model: crm.phonecall2opportunity}: |
    self.action_apply(cr, uid, [ref("crm_phonecall2opportunity_disc_openerp")], {"active_id": ref("crm_case_phone04")})
-
  I check that the phonecall and the newly created business opportunity is 
  linked to same  partner and also check with phonecall closed and opportunity
  is on intial stage or not.
-
  !python {model: crm.phonecall}: |
    phonecall = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('crm_case_phone04'))
    assert phonecall.partner_id.id == phonecall.opportunity_id.partner_id.id, "created business opportunity is not linked to same  partner"
    assert phonecall.opportunity_id.stage_id.id == ref("stage_lead1"), "Converted opportunity is not in Initial stage"
    assert phonecall.state == "done", "phonecall is held"

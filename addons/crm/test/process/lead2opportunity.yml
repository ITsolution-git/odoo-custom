  As the lead seems to be a real business opportunity, I will convert it to a partner
  and a business opportunity.
-
   !record {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner, id: crm_lead2opportunity_partner_create_1}:
      action: 'exist'
-
  Create opportunity based on exiting partner
-
   !python {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner}: |
      self.action_apply(cr, uid, [ref("crm_lead2opportunity_partner_create_1")], {'active_ids': [ref("crm_case_qrecorp0")], 'active_id': ref("crm_case_qrecorp0")})
-
  In order to test lead, i will test to lead is converted to opportunity.
-
  !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm.crm_case_qrecorp0, string: Lead is not converted on opportunity}:
    - type == 'opportunity'
-
  Finally, i won this lead, so i will close this lead.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    self.case_mark_won(cr, uid, [ref("crm_case_qrecorp0")])
-
  In order to test lead, it is close or not.
-
  !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm.crm_case_qrecorp0, string: Lead in done state}:
    - state == "done"
-
  After won this lead probability is 100.
-
  !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm.crm_case_qrecorp0, string: Probability is equal to 100}:
    - probability == 100.0
-
  In order to test stage of opportunity after win, i will test stage of opportunity.
-
  !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm.crm_case_qrecorp0, string: stage of opportunity is win}:
    - stage_id.name == "Won"

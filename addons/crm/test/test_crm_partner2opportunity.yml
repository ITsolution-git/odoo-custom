  I start by creating a new opportunity from partner.
-
  !record {model: crm.partner2opportunity, id: crm_partner2opportunity_id_0}:
    name: test
    planned_revenue: 0.0
    probability: 0.0
-
  Now, click on "Create Opportunity" button of this wizard.
-
  !python {model: crm.partner2opportunity}: |
    self.default_get(cr, uid, [ref("crm_partner2opportunity_id_0")], {"active_ids": [ref("crm_partner2opportunity_id_0")]})
- |
  In order to check the opportunity is created or not, I check type.
-
  !python {model: crm.partner2opportunity}: |
    opportunity = self.make_opportunity(cr, uid, [ref("crm_partner2opportunity_id_0")], {"active_ids": [ref("crm_partner2opportunity_id_0")]})
    assert True

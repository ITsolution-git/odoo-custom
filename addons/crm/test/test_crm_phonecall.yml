  I start by creating a new phonecall.
-
  !record {model: crm.phonecall, id: crm_phonecall_interviewcall0}:
    date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d 08:00:00')
    name: Interview call
    duration: 2.0
    section_id: crm.section_sales_department
-
  Now , I select partner by click on "Create a Partner" button.
-
  !record {model: crm.phonecall2partner, id: crm_phonecall2partner_1}:
    action: exist
    partner_id: base.res_partner_9

-
  Now, click on "Continue" button of this wizard.
-
  !python {model: crm.phonecall2partner}: |
    self.make_partner(cr, uid, [ref("crm_phonecall2partner_1")], {"active_ids": [ref("crm_phonecall_interviewcall0")]})

- |
  As the success of phonecall seems to be a real business opportunity, I will convert
  it to opportunity by clicking on the "Convert to Opportunity" button.
-
  !record {model: crm.phonecall2opportunity, id: crm_phonecall2opportunity_interviewcall0}:
    name: Interview call
    partner_id: base.res_partner_9
    planned_revenue: 0.0
    probability: 0.0
-
   Now, I click on "Convert" button of this wizard.
-
  !python {model: crm.phonecall2opportunity}: |
     self.action_apply(cr, uid, [ref("crm_phonecall2opportunity_interviewcall0")], {"active_id": ref("crm_phonecall_interviewcall0")})

- |
  I can see that a business opportunity is now assigned to this phonecall
-
  !assert {model: crm.phonecall, id: crm_phonecall_interviewcall0}:
     - opportunity_id != False

- |
  And I check that the phonecall and the newly created business opportunity is linked
  to same  partner
-
  !python {model:  crm.phonecall}: |
    obj_phonecall = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('crm_phonecall_interviewcall0'))
    ids = self.pool.get('crm.lead').search(cr, uid, [('name', '=', obj_phonecall.opportunity_id.name)])
    obj_opp = self.pool.get('crm.lead').browse(cr, uid, ids)[0]
    assert obj_phonecall.partner_id == obj_opp.partner_id

- |
  I schedule Meeting on this current phonecall by clicking on "schedule
  Meeting"
-
   !python {model: crm.phonecall}: |
     self.action_make_meeting(cr, uid, [ref('crm_phonecall_interviewcall0')])

-  |
   I can see that Meeting's calendar view is shown.
   then I click on the date on which I want schedule meeting.
   I fill proper data for that meeting and save it
-
  !record {model: crm.meeting, id: crm_meeting_interviewcall0}:
    alarm_id: base_calendar.alarm3
    date: !eval "(datetime.now()+timedelta(1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d 09:00:00')"
    date_deadline: !eval "(datetime.now()+timedelta(1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d 17:00:00')"
    duration: 8.0
    email_from: info@balmerinc.be
    name: Interview call
    partner_address_id: base.res_partner_address_1
    partner_id: base.res_partner_9
    phonecall_id: 'crm_phonecall_interviewcall0'
    state: open

- |
  In order to schedule other phonecall to the partner
  I click on "schedule other call" button. and plan for other call
  I can see that it will open other phonecall view with some data same as current
  phonecall.
-
  !record {model: crm.phonecall2phonecall, id: crm_phonecall2phonecall_interviewcall0}:
    date: !eval "(datetime.now()+timedelta(1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d 19:49:00')"
    name: Interview call
    section_id: crm.section_sales_department
    user_id: base.user_root
    categ_id: crm.categ_phone1
- |
  I click on "Schedule" button of this  wizard.
-
  !python {model: crm.phonecall2phonecall}: |
    self.action_apply(cr, uid, [ref('crm_phonecall2phonecall_interviewcall0')], {'active_id': ref('crm_phonecall_interviewcall0')})

   I start by creating a new Opportunity. And I select partner for opportunity.
   I can see that after selecting partner his contact and email is automatically filled.
-
   !record {model: crm.lead, id: crm_opportunity_abcfuelcounits0}:
    email_from: info@balmerinc.be
    name: 'ABC FUEL CO 829264 - 10002 units'
    partner_address_id: base.res_partner_address_1
    partner_id: base.res_partner_9
    probability: 1.0
    stage_id: crm.stage_opportunity1
    categ_id: crm.categ_oppor2
    section_id: crm.section_sales_department

   I check that the opportunity is in 'New' state.
-
   !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm_opportunity_abcfuelcounits0}:
     - state == "draft"
-  |
   I open opportunity by click on "Open" button,
-
   !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    self.case_open(cr, uid, [ref("crm_opportunity_abcfuelcounits0")])

-  |
   I schedule Meeting on this current opportunity by clicking on "schedule
   Meeting".
-
   !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    self.action_makeMeeting(cr, uid, [ref("crm_opportunity_abcfuelcounits0")])

-  |
   I can see that Meeting's calendar view is shown.
   then I click on the date on which I want to schedule meeting.
   I fill proper data for that meeting and save it

  !record {model: crm.meeting, id: crm_meeting_abcfuelcounits0}:
    date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d 00:00:00')

  In order to schedule a phonecall to the partner
  I click on "schedule call" button and select planned date for the call.

  !record {model: crm.opportunity2phonecall, id: crm_opportunity2phonecall_abcfuelcounits0}:
    date: !eval "(datetime.now()+timedelta(1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d 11:15:00')"

  schedule phonecall by apply (action_apply)function of opportunity2phoncall wizard

  !python {model: crm.opportunity2phonecall}: |
      self.action_apply(cr, uid, [ref('crm_opportunity2phonecall_abcfuelcounits0')], {'active_ids': [ref("crm_opportunity_abcfuelcounits0")]})
- |
  I  check that phonecall record is created for that opportunity.
-
  !python {model: crm.phonecall}: |
    phone_obj = self.pool.get('crm.phonecall')
    ids = phone_obj.search(cr, uid, [('name', '=', 'ABC FUEL CO 829264 - 10002 units')])
    assert len(ids)

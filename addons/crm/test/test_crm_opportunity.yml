   I start by creating a new Opportunity. And I select partner for opportunity.
   I can see that after selecting partner his contact and email is automatically filled.

   !record {model: crm.opportunity, id: crm_opportunity_abcfuelcounits0}:
    email_from: info@balmerinc.be
    name: 'ABC FUEL CO 829264 - 10002 units '

   I check that the opportunity is in 'New' state.

   !assert {model: crm.opportunity, id: crm_opportunity_abcfuelcounits0}:
     - state == "draft"

   I open opportunity by click on "Open" button,

   !python {model: crm.opportunity}: |
    self.case_open(cr, uid, [ref("crm_opportunity_abcfuelcounits0")])

   I schedule Meeting on this current opportunity by clicking on "schedule
   Meeting".
-
   !python {model: crm.opportunity}: |
    self.action_makeMeeting(cr, uid, [ref("crm_opportunity_abcfuelcounits0")])

   I can see that Meeting's calendar view is shown.
   then I click on the date on which I want schedule meeting.

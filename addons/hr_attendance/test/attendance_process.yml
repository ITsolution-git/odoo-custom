    In order to test attendance process in OpenERP, I perform SignIn/SignOut for an employee.
-
  !record {model: hr.sign.in.out, id: employee_sign_in}:
    emp_id: hr.employee3
    state: absent
-
  Employee Signs In.
-
  !python {model: hr.sign.in.out}: |
    import time
    from datetime import datetime, date, timedelta
    employee = self.pool.get('hr.employee').read(cr, uid, ref('hr.employee3'))
    self.write(cr, uid, [ref('employee_sign_in')], {'name': employee['name'], 'state': employee['state'], 'emp_id': employee['id']})
    self.si_check(cr, uid, [ref("employee_sign_in")])
-
  I check that Employee is "Present".
-
  !assert {model: hr.employee, id: hr.employee3, severity: error, string: Employee should be in present state}:
    - state == 'present'
-
  After few seconds, employee sign's out.
-
  !python {model: hr.sign.in.out}: |
    import time
    time.sleep(2)
    self.so_check(cr, uid, [ref("employee_sign_in")])
-
  I check that Employee is "Absent".
-
  !assert {model: hr.employee, id: hr.employee3, severity: error, string: Employee should be in absent state}:
    - state == 'absent'

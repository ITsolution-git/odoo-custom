  In order to test effect of cancelling Internal picking on production order, I first confirm order for PC3.
-
  !workflow {model: mrp.production, action: button_confirm, ref: mrp_production_order3}
-
  I check that the related internal picking is waiting availability.
-
  !assert {model: mrp.production, id: mrp_production_order3}:
    - picking_id.state == 'confirmed'
-
  In order to cancel the production order, I first cancel its picking.
-
  !function {model: stock.picking, name: action_cancel}:
    - model: mrp.production
      eval: "[obj(ref('mrp_production_order3')).picking_id.id]"
-
  Now I cancel the production order.
-
  !workflow {model: mrp.production, action: button_cancel, ref: mrp_production_order3}
-
  Now I check that the production order is cancelled.
-
  !assert {model: mrp.production, id: mrp_production_order3}:
    - state == 'cancel'
-
  I remove this production order.
-
  !delete {model: mrp.production, id: mrp_production_order3}

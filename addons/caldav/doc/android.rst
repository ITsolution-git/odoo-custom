There is no buit-in way to synchronize calendar with caldav.
So you need to install a third part software : Calendar (CalDav) 
for now it's the only one

configuration
-------------

1. Open Calendar Sync
   I'll get an interface with 2 tabs
   Stay on the first one
   
2. CaDAV Calendar URL : put the URL given above (ie : http://host.com:8069/webdav/db/calendars/users/demo/c/Meetings)

3. Put your openerp username and password

4. If your server don't use SSL, you'll get a warnign, say "Yes"

5. Then you can synchronize manually or custom the settings to synchronize every x minutes.

   I will test base_contact for following cases:
    *contacts unrelated to a partner,
    *contacts working at several addresses (possibly for different partners),
    *contacts with possibly different functions for each of its job's addresses
-  |
   In order to check contacts first I will create contact unrelated to a partner
- 
    !record {model: res.partner.contact, id: res_partner_contact_williams0}:
        country_id: base.be
        first_name: Laura
        job_ids:
            - email: lwilliams@mydomain.com
              function: PA
              phone: (+32).10.45.18.77
        mobile: (+32).10.45.18.77
        name: Williams
-   |
    Now in order to assign this contact to partner I will create one partner assign contact laura to this partner
- 
    !record {model: res.partner, id: res_partner_laurascompany0}:
        address:
            - city: Namur
              country_id: base.be
              phone: (+32).10.45.18.77
              street: 23, street ways
              type: default
              zip: '2324324'
              job_ids:
                - function: CEO
                  contact_id: res_partner_contact_williams0
        name: Lauras Company
        ref: LC
- 
    Now I will check that the new job is assigned properly to contact or not
-
    !assert {model: res.partner.contact, id: res_partner_contact_williams0}:
        - len(job_ids) == 2

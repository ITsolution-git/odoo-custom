        This module allows you to manage entirely your contacts. 

    It lets you define 
        *contacts unrelated to a partner,
        *contacts working at several adresses (possibly for different partners), 
        *contacts with possibly different functions for each of its job's addresses

    It also add new menuitems located in 
        Partners \ Contacts
        Partners \ Functions


    Pay attention that this module converts the existing addresses into "addresses + contacts". It means that some fields of the addresses will be missing (like the contact name), since these are supposed to be defined in an other object.

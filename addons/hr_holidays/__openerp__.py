    This module allows you to manage leaves and leaves' requests.
    Implements a dashboard for human resource management that includes.
        * My Leaves
        * My Expenses
    Note that:
    - A synchronisation with an internal agenda (use of the CRM module) is possible: in order to automatically create a case when an holiday request is accepted, you have to link the holidays status to a case section. You can set up this info and your colour preferences in
                HR / Configuration / Holidays Status
    - An employee can make an ask for more off-days by making a new Allocation It will increase his total of that leave type available (if the request is accepted).
    - There are two ways to print the employee's holidays:
        * The first will allow to choose employees by department and is used by clicking the menu item located in
                HR / Holidays Request / Print Summary of Holidays
        * The second will allow you to choose the holidays report for specific employees. Go on the list
                HR / Employees / Employees
            then select the ones you want to choose, click on the print icon and select the option
                'Print Summary of Employee's Holidays'
    - The wizard allows you to choose if you want to print either the Confirmed & Validated holidays or only the Validated ones. These states must be set up by a user from the group 'HR'. You can define these features in the security tab from the user data in
                Administration / Users / Users
            for example, you maybe will do it for the user 'admin'
            .

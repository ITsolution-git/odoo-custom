This module allows you to manage leaves and leave requests.
===========================================================

Implements a dashboard for human resource management that includes:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Leaves

Note that:
~~~~~~~~~~
    - A synchronisation with an internal agenda (use of the CRM module) is
      possible: in order to automatically create a case when an holiday request
      is accepted, you have to link the holidays status to a case section. You
      can setup this info and your colour preferences in
      
          **Human Resources** / **Configuration** / **Leave Type**
    - An employee can make an ask for more off-days by making a new Allocation. It will increase his total of that leave type available (if the request is accepted).
    - There are two ways to print the employee's holidays:
        * The first will allow to choose employees by department and is used by clicking the menu item located in
                **Reporting** / **Human Resources** / **Leaves** / **Leaves by Department**
        * The second will allow you to choose the holidays report for specific employees. Go on the list
                **Human Resources** / **Human Resources** / **Employees**
                then select the ones you want to choose, click on the print icon and select the option
                'Leaves Summary'
    - The wizard allows you to choose if you want to print either the Approved & Confirmed holidays or both. These states must be set up by a user from the group 'HR'. You can define these features in the security tab from the user data in
                **Settings** / **Users** / **Users**
                
                for example, you maybe will do it for the user 'admin'.

Members of this group are allowed to share documents with Groups in addition to Users, and have a few more options in the share wizard. This is useful for setting up Portals
with the portal module, but this could result in an alteration of the system's security policy.
Therefore this should be granted only to trustworthy users who know the security policy very well.
This group should not be deleted.</field>

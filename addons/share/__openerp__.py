    This module adds generic sharing tools to your current OpenERP database,
    and specifically a 'share' button that is available in the Web client to
    share any kind of OpenERP data with colleagues, customers, friends, etc.

    The system will work by creating new users and groups on the fly, and by
    combining the appropriate access rights and ir.rules to ensure that the
    shared users only have access to the data that has been shared with them.

    This is extremely useful for collaborative work, knowledge sharing, 
    synchronization with other companies, etc.

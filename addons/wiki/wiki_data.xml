 This is a test Formatting

==Bold Italic, and Underline Test==
You can ''italicize text'' by putting 2 
apostrophes on each side. 
3 apostrophes will embolden '''the text'''. 
5 apostrophes will embolden and italicize 
'''''the text'''''.
(4 apostrophes don't do anything
special -- there's just ''''one left
over''''.)
==Text with bullets==
You should "sign" your comments 
on talk pages:
* Three tildes give your user
name: ~~~
* Four tildes give your user 
name plus date/time: ~~~~
* Five tildes give the 
date/time alone: ~~~~~
==Formatting Test - 3==
== Section headings ==
''Headings'' organize your writing into sections.
The Wiki software can automatically generate
a table of contents from them.
=== Subsection ===
Using more equals signs creates a subsection.
==== A smaller subsection ====
Don't skip levels, 
like from two to four equals signs.
Start with 2 equals signs not 1 
because 1 creates H1 tags
which should be reserved for page title.
==Formatting Test - 4==
* ''Unordered lists'' are easy to do:
** Start every line with a star.
*** More stars indicate a deeper level.
*: Previous item continues.
** A new line
* in a list  
marks the end of the list.
* Of course you can start again.
==Formatting Test - 5==
# ''Numbered lists'' are:
## Very organized
## Easy to follow
#: Previous item continues
A new line marks the end of the list.
# New numbering starts with 1.
==Formatting Test - 6==
: A colon (:) indents a line or paragraph.
A newline starts a new paragraph. <br>
Often used for discussion on talk pages.
: We use 1 colon to indent once.
:: We use 2 colons to indent twice.
::: 3 colons to indent 3 times, and so on.
==Formatting Test - 7==
Here's a link to the [[ Main page ]].
==Formatting Test - 8==
[[Intentionally permanent red link]] is 
a page that doesn't exist
yet. You could create it by 
clicking on the link.
==Formatting Test - 9==
You can link to a page section by its title:
* [[Help:Contents#For editors]].
If multiple sections have the same title, add
a number. [[#Example section 3]] goes to the
third section named "Example section".
==Formatting Test-10==
Here's a ''definition list'':
; Word : Definition of the word
; A longer phrase needing definition
: Phrase defined
; A word : Which has a definition
: Also a second one
: And even a third

Begin with a semicolon. One item per line; 
a newline can appear before the colon, but 
using a space before the colon improves 
parsing.
==Formatting Test - 11==
You can add footnotes to sentences using
the ''ref'' tag -- this is especially good
for citing a source.

:There are over six billion people in the
world.<ref>CIA World Factbook, 2006.</ref>

For details, see [[Footnotes | Wikipedia:Footnotes]] 
and [[Help:Footnotes]].
==Formatting Test - 12==
This is a Link
[[Page | MainPage]] do not show up in line
but instead at page bottom
''and cause the page to be listed in the category.''
[[Category:English documentation]]

Add an extra colon to ''link'' to a category in line
without causing the page to be listed in the category:
[[:Category:English documentation]]

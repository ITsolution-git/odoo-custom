  In order to test to delete process on purchase requisition order.
-
  I delete draft purchase requisition order.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    self.unlink(cr, uid, [ref("order_purchase_requisition1")])
-
  Now I try to cancel purchase requisition order.
-
  !python {model: purchase.requisition}: |
    self.tender_cancel(cr, uid, [ref("order_purchase_requisition1")])
-
  I delete cancelled purchase requisition order.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    self.unlink(cr, uid, [ref("order_purchase_requisition1")])

  In order to create a Quotatoion, I click on the wizard 'Request a Quotation' and create record from wizard.
- 
  !record {model: purchase.requisition.partner, id: purchase_requisition_partner_0}:
    partner_address_id: base.res_partner_address_3000
    partner_id: base.res_partner_desertic_hispafuentes
- 
  I click on 'Create Quotation' for creating PO.
- 
  !python {model: purchase.requisition.partner}: |
    self.create_order(cr, uid, [ref("purchase_requisition_partner_0")], {"active_model": "purchase.requisition",
      "active_ids": [ref("order_purchase_requisition1")],"active_id": ref("order_purchase_requisition1"), })
-
  I check that the purchase order is created.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    purchase_ids= self.search(cr, uid, [('requisition_id','=',ref("order_purchase_requisition1"))])
    assert purchase_ids, "Purchase Order is not created from this wizard"
    rfq = self.browse(cr, uid, purchase_ids[0])
    assert rfq.state == 'draft',"Purchase Order should be in draft state"
    assert rfq.partner_address_id.id == ref('base.res_partner_address_3000'),"Purchase Order Partner address is not correspond"
    assert rfq.partner_id.id == ref('base.res_partner_desertic_hispafuentes'),"Purchase Order Partner is not correspond"

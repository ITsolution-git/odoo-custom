  I want to organize event and its need Minimum 50 Registrations to confirm/start 
  this Event, but Only 10 registration confirm for this event, I confirm this event. 
-
  !python {model: event.event}: |
    self.button_confirm(cr, uid, [ref("event_1")])
-
  Now I cheked for event and It should not be confirm because registrations for 
  this event is below limit.
-
  !assert {model: event.event, id: event_1}:
    - state == 'confirm', "Event should be confirm."
-
  So I cancel this Event
-
  !python {model: event.event}: |
    self.button_cancel(cr, uid, [ref("event_1")])
-
  I check event should be cancel.
-
  !assert {model: event.event, id: event_1}:
    - state == 'cancel', "Event should be cancel"

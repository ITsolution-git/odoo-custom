  Now I check claims which contain customer claim information about document
  related problem, product related problem. 
- |
  I start by creating new claims for Damaged product as Value Claims with priority High and specify 
  date of claim at which  claim is created.
- 
  !record {model: crm.claim, id: crm_claim_damagedproduct0}:
    categ_id: crm_claim.categ_claim2
    date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    email_from: info@balmerinc.be
    name: 'Damaged product '
    partner_address_id: base.res_partner_address_1
    partner_id: base.res_partner_9
    priority: '2'
    section_id: crm.section_sales_department

- |
  I check that the claims  is in 'draft' state.
-
  !assert {model: crm.claim, id: crm_claim_damagedproduct0}:
    - state == 'draft'
- |
  I can change that stage by next button right on it
-
  !python {model: crm.claim}: |
    self.stage_next(cr, uid, [ref('crm_claim_damagedproduct0')])      
- |
  I make this claim as Open
-
  !python {model: crm.claim}: |
    self.case_open(cr, uid, [ref('crm_claim_damagedproduct0')])

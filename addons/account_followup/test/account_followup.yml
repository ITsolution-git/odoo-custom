  In order to test account follow-up module in OpenERP, I change the state of invoice to "open".
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: account.demo_invoice_0}:
    check_total: 14.0
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: account.demo_invoice_0}
-
  I create a follow-up.
-
  !record {model: account.followup.print, id: account_followup_print_0}:
    {}
-
  I select the follow-up to send it to the partner.
-
  !python {model: account.followup.print}: |
    self.do_continue(cr, uid, [ref("account_followup_print_0")], {"active_ids": [ref("account_followup.account_followup_print_menu")], "active_id": ref("account_followup.account_followup_print_menu"),
      })
-
  I select partners whom I want to send follow-ups.
-
  !record {model: account.followup.print.all, id: account_followup_print_all_0}:
    email_body: 'Date : %(date)s\n\nDear %(partner_name)s,\n\nPlease find in attachment
      a reminder of all your unpaid invoices, for a total amount due of:\n\n%(followup_amount).2f
      %(company_currency)s\n\nThanks,\n--\n%(user_signature)s\n%(company_name)s'
    email_subject: Invoices Reminder
    partner_ids:
      - base.res_partner_desertic_hispafuentes
    partner_lang: 1
-
  I send a follow-up mail to partner.
-
  !python {model: account.followup.print.all}: |
    import time
    self.do_mail(cr, uid, [ref("account_followup_print_all_0")], {"active_ids": [ref("account_followup.account_followup_print_menu")], "date": time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), "followup_id": ref("account_followup.demo_followup1"), "active_id": ref("account_followup.account_followup_print_menu"),
      })

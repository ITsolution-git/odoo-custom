  In order to test account follow-up module in OpenERP, I change the state of invoice to "open".
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: account.demo_invoice_0}:
    check_total: 14.0
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: account.demo_invoice_0}
-
  I create a follow-up.
-
  !record {model: account.followup.print, id: account_followup_print_0}:
    {}
- 
  I will process follow-ups
- 
  !python {model: account.followup.print}:  |
    self.do_process(cr, uid, [ref("account_followup_print_0")], {"active_ids": [ref("account_followup.account_followup_print_menu")], "active_id": ref("account_followup.account_followup_print_menu"),})

It is difficult, in an open project as an OpenERp module,
to aknowledge all the contributors.
Software is read, studied, modified ad redistributed too 
many time to know who originally made the different parts. 

This module was developed in june 2010 by Servabit srl
( http://www.servabit.it ).

It inherits the work of the italian OpenERP community 
( http://www.openerp-italia.com ), by Davide Corio and 
many others, with their modules: l10n_it, l10n_chart_it_cc2424.

The module l10n_fr (by JAILLET Simon - CrysaLEAD - www.crysalead.fr)
was also used.

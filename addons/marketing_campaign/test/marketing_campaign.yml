  In order to test process of compaign, I start compaign.
-
  !workflow {model: marketing.campaign, action: state_running_set, ref: marketing_campaign_openerppartnerchannel}
-
  I check the campaign on Running mode after started.
-
  !assert {model: marketing.campaign, id: marketing_campaign_openerppartnerchannel}:
    - state == 'running'
-
  I start this segment after assinged campaign.
-
  !workflow {model: marketing.campaign.segment, action: state_running_set, ref: marketing_campaign_segment0}
-
  I check the segment on Running mode after started.
-
  !assert {model: marketing.campaign.segment, id: marketing_campaign_segment0}:
    - state == 'running'
-
  I synchronized segment manually to see all step of activity and process covered on this campaign.
-
  !python {model: marketing.campaign.segment}: |
    self.synchroniz(cr, uid, [ref("marketing_campaign_segment0")])
-
  I check followup detail of first activity.
-
  !python {model: marketing.campaign.workitem}: |
    ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('segment_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_segment0')),
    ('campaign_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_openerppartnerchannel')), ('activity_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_activity_0'))])
    assert ids, 'Followup item is not created for first activity.'
-  
  I process followup of first activity.
-
  !python {model: marketing.campaign.workitem}: |
    ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('segment_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_segment0')),
    ('campaign_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_openerppartnerchannel')), ('activity_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_activity_0'))])
    self.process(cr, uid, ids)
    record = self.browse(cr, uid, ids)[0]
    assert record.state == "done", "Followup item should be closed after process."
-
  I check followup detail of second activity after process of first activity.
-
  !python {model: marketing.campaign.workitem}: |
    ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('segment_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_segment0')),
    ('campaign_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_openerppartnerchannel')), ('activity_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_activity_1'))])
    assert ids, 'Followup item is not created for second activity.'
-
  Now I increase credit limit of customer
-
  !python {model: res.partner}: |
    self.write(cr, uid, [ref("base.res_partner_agrolait")], {'credit_limit':41000}, context=context)
-  
  I process followup of second activity after set draft.
-
  !python {model: marketing.campaign.workitem}: |
    ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('segment_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_segment0')),
    ('campaign_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_openerppartnerchannel')), ('activity_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_activity_1'))])
    self.button_draft(cr, uid, ids, context=context)
    self.process(cr, uid, ids, context=context)
    record = self.browse(cr, uid, ids[0], context=context)
    assert record.state == "done", "Followup item should be closed after process."
-
  I check followup detail of third activity after process of second activity.
-
  !python {model: marketing.campaign.workitem}: |
    ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('segment_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_segment0')),
    ('campaign_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_openerppartnerchannel')), ('activity_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_activity_2'))])
    assert ids, 'Followup item is not created for third activity.'
-
  Now I increase credit limit of customer
-
  !python {model: res.partner}: |
    self.write(cr, uid, [ref("base.res_partner_agrolait")], {'credit_limit':151000}, context=context)
-  
  I process followup of third activity after set draft.
-
  !python {model: marketing.campaign.workitem}: |
    ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('segment_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_segment0')),
    ('campaign_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_openerppartnerchannel')), ('activity_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_activity_2'))])
    self.button_draft(cr, uid, ids, context=context)
    self.process(cr, uid, ids, context=context)
    record = self.browse(cr, uid, ids[0], context=context)
    assert record.state == "done", "Followup item should be closed after process."
-
  I print workitem report.
-
  !python {model: marketing.campaign.workitem}: |
    ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('segment_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_segment0')),
    ('campaign_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_openerppartnerchannel')), ('activity_id', '=', ref('marketing_campaign_activity_2'))])
    self.preview(cr, uid, ids)
-
  I close segmentation After completion of all activity. 
-
  !workflow {model: marketing.campaign.segment, action: state_done_set, ref: marketing_campaign_segment0}
-
  I check the segmentation is done.
-
  !assert {model: marketing.campaign.segment, id: marketing_campaign_segment0}:
    - state == 'done'
-
  I close this campaing.
-
  !workflow {model: marketing.campaign.segment, action: state_done_set, ref: marketing_campaign_openerppartnerchannel}
-
  I check the campaing is done.
-
  !assert {model: marketing.campaign.segment, id: marketing_campaign_openerppartnerchannel}:
    - state == 'done'

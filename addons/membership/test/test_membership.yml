  In Order to test the Membership in OpenERP, which allows us to manage all operations for managing memberships.
- |
  We have to create "Membership Products" to make it available for partner or customer to make membership with it.
  select product type   to "service" type and membership field is ticked to visible this product while creating membership for the partner.
- 
  !record {model: product.product, id: product_product_membershipproduct0}:
    categ_id: product.cat1
    membership: 1
    membership_date_from: '2009-06-01'
    membership_date_to: '2010-06-01'
    name: Membership Products
    type: service
    list_price: 80.00

  I create new member "Mark Johnson" and I provide an address to this
  new customer, as well as an email "info@mycustomer.com".
- 
  !record {model: res.partner, id: res_partner_markjohnson0}:
    address:
      - city: paris
        country_id: base.fr
        name: Arthur Grosbonnet
        street: 1 rue Rockfeller
        type: default
        zip: '75016'
    credit_limit: 0.0
    membership_amount: 0.0
    name: Mark Johnson
    property_account_payable: account.a_pay
    property_account_receivable: account.a_recv

- |
  I check that "Current membership state" is set to "Non Member". 
- 
  !assert {model: res.partner, id: res_partner_markjohnson0}:
      - membership_state == 'none'
- |  
  I can make it a Free member by selecting the "Free member" check box.
- 
  !record {model: res.partner, id: membership.res_partner_markjohnson0}:
    free_member: 1
- |
  Now, I create Membership Invoices using wizard available on partner and  Select Membership Product.
- 
  !record {model: membership.invoice, id: membership_invoice_0}:
    product_id: membership.product_product_membershipproduct0
    
- |
  I click on "Confirm" button of this wizard. and also check that address is defined or not for this partner in this function.  
- 
  !python {model: membership.invoice}: |
    self.membership_invoice(cr, uid, [ref("membership_invoice_0")], {"active_ids": [ref("membership.res_partner_markjohnson0")]})

- |
  I check that Invoice is created for this members.
-
  !python {model: res.partner}: |
  
        from tools.translate import _
        invoice_obj = self.pool.get('account.invoice')
        partner_obj = self.pool.get('res.partner')
        product_obj = self.pool.get('product.product')
        invoice_line_obj = self.pool.get('account.invoice.line')
        
        partner_id = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('res_partner_markjohnson0'))
        inv_ids = invoice_obj.search(cr, uid, [('partner_id', '=', partner_id.id), ('account_id', '=', partner_id.property_account_receivable.id)])
        invoice_id = invoice_obj.browse(cr, uid, inv_ids)[0]
        product = product_obj.browse(cr, uid, ref('product_product_membershipproduct0'), context=context)        
        line_ids = invoice_line_obj.search(cr, uid, [('product_id', '=', product.id), ('invoice_id', '=', invoice_id.id)])
        
        assert line_ids, _('Invoices has not been generated for this Member!')
         
- |
  I check that the "Current membership state" will remain same untill opening the invoice.
-
  !assert {model: res.partner, id: res_partner_markjohnson0}:
     - membership_state == 'free'  
  
- |
  "Current membership state" of any member depends on the state of invoice.
  So, I check that  invoice is in draft state then the "membership state" of a member is "Waiting member".
-
  !python {model: membership.membership_line}: |
        partner_obj = self.pool.get('res.partner')    
        inv_obj = self.pool.get('account.invoice')
        
        partner_id = partner_obj.browse(cr, uid, ref('res_partner_markjohnson0'))
        member_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('partner', '=', partner_id.id)])
        current_id = self.browse(cr, uid, member_ids)[0]
        
        inv_ids = inv_obj.search(cr, uid, [('partner_id', '=', partner_id.id), ('account_id', '=', partner_id.property_account_receivable.id)])
        inv_id = inv_obj.browse(cr, uid, inv_ids)[0]
        if inv_id.state == 'draft':
            assert current_id.state == 'waiting'

  When the invoice is in open state it become Invoiced Member, When the invoice is in paid state the same "Current membership state" changed to Paid Member. 
  Now, If we cancel the invoice "Current membership state" changed to Cancel Member.

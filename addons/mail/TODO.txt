Backend:
* remove _message_search_ancestor_ids and implement in message_read (must use browse records instead of IDS)
* I propose to move message_read in mail.message and rename to message_fetch

* remove message_search (objects can overwrite message_ids if they want a custom list of messages)
    - requires to reimplement message_read

* remove _message_find_user_id and use _message_find_partners
    - it requires to change the route code

Web Stuff to Do:
* replace comments_structure by a real tree structure, provided by message_read directly
* rewrite completly records_struct_add_records, merge existing messages with those coming from another message_read
* remove records_struct_update_after_display:
* remove all is_wall stuff and pass real arguments
* remove init_and_fetch_comments
* rename fetch_comments into message_read
* implement display_current_user --> check why it's present two times

To Check:
* check if addons modules rely on some stuff changed in the aboce backend section

To ask ODO:
* message_forward for mail gateway (redundant with notifications by emails ?)
    -> I removed it to rely on notifications

Backend:
* I propose to move message_read in mail.message and rename to message_fetch

* remove _message_find_user_id and use _message_find_partners
    - it requires to change the route code

Web Stuff to Do:
* replace comments_structure by a real tree structure, provided by message_read directly
* rewrite completly records_struct_add_records, merge existing messages with those coming from another message_read
     -> false records with domain message_read
* remove records_struct_update_after_display
* remove all is_wall stuff and pass real arguments
* remove init_and_fetch_comments
* rename fetch_comments into message_read
Not Sure:
    * implement display_current_user --> check why it's present two times

To Check:
* check if addons modules rely on some stuff changed in the aboce backend section

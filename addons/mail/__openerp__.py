A generic email subsystem with message storage and queuing
==========================================================

This email subsystem is not intended to be used as as standalone
application, but to provide a unified email abstraction that all
other applications can use.

The main features are:

    * Relies on the global Outgoing Mail Servers configured in the 
      Administration menu for delivering outgoing mail
    * Provides an API for sending messages and archiving them,
      grouped by conversation
    * Any OpenERP document can act as a conversation topic, provided
      it includes the necessary support for handling incoming emails
      (see the ``mail.thread`` class for more details). 
    * Includes queuing mechanism with automated configurable
      scheduler-based processing
    * Includes a generic email composition assistant, that can turn
      into a mass-mailing assistant, and is capable of interpreting
      simple *placeholder expressions* that will be replaced with
      dynamic data when each email is actually sent.
      This generic assistant is easily extensible to provide advanced
      features (see ``email_template`` for example, which adds email
      templating features to this assistant)

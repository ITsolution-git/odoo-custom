    """A Mail Alias is a mapping of an email address with a given OpenERP Document
       model. It is used by OpenERP's mail gateway when processing incoming emails
       sent to the system. If the recipient address (To) of the message matches
       a Mail Alias, the message will be either processed following the rules
       of that alias. If the message is a reply it will be attached to the
       existing discussion on the corresponding record, otherwise a new
       record of the corresponding model will be created.
       
       This is meant to be used in combination with a catch-all email configuration
       on the company's mail server, so that as soon as a new mail.alias is
       created, it becomes immediately usable and OpenERP will accept email for it.

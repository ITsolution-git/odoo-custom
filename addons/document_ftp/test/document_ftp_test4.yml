    In order to check dynamic folder functionality of document + FTP
-
    I create two partners 'Partner1' and 'Partner2'
-|
    I create three partner categories: 'none', 'pat1' and 'all'
    I attach Partner1 to pat1, Partner1+Partner2 to 'all'
-
    I create a resource folder of partners, by the (none, pat1, all) 
    categories.
-
    I browse through ftp in the resource folder, checking that three
    categories are there.
-
    I create a 'partners' folder by the first resource one.
-
    I check through FTP that the correct partners are listed at each
    'partners' folder.
-
    I create an ir.attachment, attached (not related) to Partner1
    
-
    I check that pat1/Partner1 folder has the file.
    I check that all/Partner1 folder has the file
-
    I place a file at the 'pat1'/Partner1 folder, through FTP
-
    I check at the server that the file is attached to Partner1
-
    I check that all/Partner1 also has the file

    Bonus Piste:
    I create a 'Partner3' under 'all'

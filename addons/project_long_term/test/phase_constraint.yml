  Creating 3 consecutive 5-days phases.
  For that Creating a Analyst Human resource to analyst Project Yaml.
- 
  !record {model: resource.resource, id: resource_resource_analyst1}:
    calendar_id: project_long_term.resource_calendar_hoursweeks0
    name: Analyst
    resource_type: user
    time_efficiency: 1.0
    user_id: base.user_admin
    
- 
  Creating Developer Human resource who develop Yaml
- 
  !record {model: resource.resource, id: resource_resource_develop0}:
    calendar_id: project_long_term.resource_calendar_hoursweeks0
    name: Developer
    resource_type: user
    time_efficiency: 1.0
    user_id: base.user_admin
- 
  Creating a Tester Human resource for testing Yaml
- 
  !record {model: resource.resource, id: resource_resource_tester1}:
    calendar_id: project_long_term.resource_calendar_hoursweeks0
    name: tester
    resource_type: user
    time_efficiency: 1.0
    user_id: base.user_admin
    
- 
  Create 3 a project phase and NO one  depends on other one.
  so,they should start on the same day. 
  Creating First 'Analysis Flow for Yaml' Project Phase.
- 
  !record {model: project.phase, id: project_phase_analysisflowforyaml0}:
    date_start: '2010-01-05'
    duration: 5.0
    name: "Analysis Flow for Yaml"
    product_uom: product.uom_day
    project_id: project_project_developyamlproject0
    responsible_id: project.res_users_analyst
    state: draft
    resource_ids:
      - resource_id: resource_resource_analyst1  
    
- 
  Create project phase 'Develop yaml' with constraint date.
- 
  !record {model: project.phase, id: project_phase_developyaml0}:
    date_start: '2010-01-05'
    constraint_date_start: '2010-01-07'
    duration: 5.0
    name: Develop Yaml
    product_uom: product.uom_day
    project_id: project_project_developyamlproject0
    resource_ids: 
      - resource_id: resource_resource_develop0  
- 
  Create project phase 'Test Yaml'
- 
  !record {model: project.phase, id: project_phase_testyaml0}:
    date_start: '2010-01-05'
    duration: 5.0
    name: Testing Yaml
    product_uom: product.uom_day
    project_id: project_project_developyamlproject0
    resource_ids: 
      - resource_id: resource_resource_tester1     
    
- 
  Compute Schedule of phases For One project 
- 
  !record {model: project.compute.phases, id: project_compute_phases_0}:
    project_id: project_project_developyamlproject0
    target_project: one
    
- 
  Schedule project phases using "Compute Phase Scheduling"
- 
  !python {model: project.project}: |
    self.schedule_phases(cr, uid, [ref("project_project_developyamlproject0")])
      
-
  After  scheduling,check that 
  Phase "Analysis Flow for Yaml" and "Test Yaml" Phase should start on the project start date while "Develop yaml" Phase should respect the constraint. 
-
  !python {model: project.project}: |
     proj=self.browse(cr, uid, [ref("project_project_developyamlproject0")])[0]
     for phase in proj.phase_ids:
        for phase1 in proj.phase_ids:
             if phase1.id != phase.id and phase.constraint_date_start == phase1.date_start:
               raise AssertionError("Phases not scheduled")

  In order to test the process of payment order
-
  I perform action to change the state of payment order to "confirmed"
-
  !workflow {model: payment.order, action: open, ref: account_payment.payment_order_1}
-
  I check that Payment order is now "Confirmed"
-
  !assert {model: payment.order, id: account_payment.payment_order_1}:
    - state == 'open'
-
  In order to no payment line so I perform action to change the state of payment order to "cancel"
-
  !python {model: payment.order}: |
    self.set_to_draft(cr, uid, [ref("account_payment.payment_order_1")])
-
  I check that Payment order is now "draft"
-
  !assert {model: payment.order, id: account_payment.payment_order_1}:

This module allows you to create a new module without any development.
It records all operations on objects during the recording session and
produce a .ZIP module. So you can create your own module directly from
the Tiny ERP client.

This version works for creating and updating existing records. It recomputes
dependencies and links for all types of widgets (many2one, many2many, ...).
It also support workflows and demo/update data.

This should help you to easily create reuseable and publishable modules
for custom configurations and demo/testing data.

How to use it:
1. Start the recording
2. Do stuff in your Tiny ERP client
3. Stop the recording session
4. Export to a reusable module

  I check that there is one Work order generated related to the production order of 5 CPU_GEN.
-
  !python {model: mrp.production.workcenter.line}: |
    from tools.translate import _
    order_id = self.search(cr, uid, [('production_id','=', ref('mrp_production_mo1')),('state','=','draft')])
    assert order_id, _('No work order defined for this production order!')
-
  In order to cancel the production order, I first cancel its picking.
-
  !function {model: stock.picking, name: action_cancel}:
    - model: mrp.production
      eval: "[obj(ref('mrp_production_mo1')).picking_id.id]"
-
  Now I cancel the production order.
-
  !workflow {model: mrp.production, action: button_cancel, ref: mrp_production_mo1}
-
  Now I check that the production order is cancelled.
-
  !assert {model: mrp.production, id: mrp_production_mo1}:
    - state == 'cancel'
-
  I check that the work order related to the production order that is cancelled or not.
-
  !python {model: mrp.production.workcenter.line}: |
    from tools.translate import _
    order_id = self.search(cr, uid, [('production_id','=', ref('mrp_production_mo1')),('state','=','cancel')])
    assert order_id, _('Work order is not cancelled for this production order!')

  In Order to Test process of Project Agile Methology,
-
  I put Backlog in pending state because of specification is not ready.
-
  !python {model: project.scrum.product.backlog}: |
    self.button_pending(cr, uid, [ref("scrum_product_backlog_0")])
-
  I check state of Backlog after put in pending.
-
  !assert {model: project.scrum.product.backlog, id: scrum_product_backlog_0, severity: error, string: Backlog should be in pending state}:
       - state == "pending"
-
  Now Specification is ready so I Open backlog "Automatic migration system".
-
  !python {model: project.scrum.product.backlog}: |
    self.button_open(cr, uid, [ref("scrum_product_backlog_0")])
-
  I check state of Backlog after opened.
-
  !assert {model: project.scrum.product.backlog, id: scrum_product_backlog_0, severity: error, string: Backlog should be in open state}:
       - state == "open"
-
  I close Backlog after review.
-
  !python {model: project.scrum.product.backlog}: |
    self.button_close(cr, uid, [ref("scrum_product_backlog_0")])
-
  I check state of Backlog after closed.
-
  !assert {model: project.scrum.product.backlog, id: scrum_product_backlog_0, severity: error, string: Backlog should be in close state}:
       - state == "done"
-
  I merge two Backlogs in to one Backlog.
-
  !python {model: project.scrum.backlog.merge}: |
    self.check_backlogs(cr, uid, [ref("scrum_product_backlog_1"),ref("scrum_product_backlog_2")], {"active_ids": [ref("scrum_product_backlog_1"),ref("scrum_product_backlog_2")],
    "active_id": ref("scrum_product_backlog_1")
    })

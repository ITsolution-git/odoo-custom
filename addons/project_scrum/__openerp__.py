    'version': '1.0',
    'category': 'Project Management',
    'description': """
This module implements all concepts defined by the scrum project management methodology for IT companies.
=========================================================================================================

    * Project with sprints, product owner, scrum master
    * Sprints with reviews, daily meetings, feedbacks
    * Product backlog
    * Sprint backlog

It adds some concepts to the project management module:
    * Mid-term, long-term road-map
    * Customers/functional requests VS technical ones

It also creates a new reporting:
    * Burn-down chart

The scrum projects and tasks inherit from the real projects and
tasks, so you can continue working on normal tasks that will also
include tasks from scrum projects.

More information on the methodology:

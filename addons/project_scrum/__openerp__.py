    'name': 'Scrum, Agile Development Method',
    'version': '1.0',
    'category': 'Enterprise Specific Modules/Information Technology',
    'description': """
    This module implements all concepts defined by the scrum project
    management methodology for IT companies:
    * Project with sprints, product owner, scrum master
    * Sprints with reviews, daily meetings, feedbacks
    * Product backlog
    * Sprint backlog

    It adds some concepts to the project management module:
    * Mid-term, long-term road-map
    * Customers/functional requests VS technical ones

    It also creates a new reporting:
    * Burn-down chart

    The scrum projects and tasks inherit from the real projects and
    tasks, so you can continue working on normal tasks that will also
    include tasks from scrum projects.

    More information on the methodology:

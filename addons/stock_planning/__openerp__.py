MPS allows to create a manual procurement plan apart of the normal MRP scheduling, which works automatically based on minimum stock rules
=========================================================================================================================================

Quick Glossary
--------------
- Stock Period - the time boundaries (between Start Date and End Date) for your Sales and Stock forecasts and planning
- Sales Forecast - the quantity of products you plan to sell during the related Stock Period.
- Stock Planning - the quantity of products you plan to purchase or produce for the related Stock Period.

To avoid confusion with the terms used by the ``sale_forecast`` module, ("Sales Forecast" and "Planning" are amounts) we use terms "Stock and Sales Forecast" and "Stock Planning" to emphasize that we use quantity values.

Where to begin
--------------
Using this module is done in three steps:

 * Create Stock Periods via the Warehouse>Configuration>Stock Periods menu (Mandatory step)
 * Create Sale Forecasts fill them with forecast quantities, via the Sales>Sales Forecast menu. (Optional step but useful for further planning)
 * Create the actual MPS plan, check the balance and trigger the procurements as required. The actual procurement is the final step for the Stock Period.

Stock Period configuration
--------------------------
You have two menu items for Periods in "Warehouse > Configuration > Stock Periods". There are:

 * "Create Stock Periods" - can automatically creating daily, weekly or monthly periods.
 * "Stock Periods" - allows to create any type of periods, change the dates and change the state of period.

Creating periods is the first step. You can create custom periods using the "New" button in "Stock Periods", but it is recommended to use the automatic assistant "Create Stock Periods".

Remarks:

 - These periods (Stock Periods) are completely distinct from Financial or other periods in the system.
 - Periods are not assigned to companies (when you use multicompany). Module suppose that you use the same periods across companies. If you wish to use different periods for different companies define them as you wish (they can overlap). Later on in this text will be indications how to use such periods.
 - When periods are created automatically their start and finish dates are with start hour 00:00:00 and end hour 23:59:00. When you create daily periods they will have start date 31.01.2010 00:00:00 and end date 31.01.2010 23:59:00. It works only in automatic creation of periods. When you create periods manually you have to take care about hours because you can have incorrect values form sales or stock.
 - If you use overlapping periods for the same product, warehouse and company results can be unpredictable.
 - If current date doesn't belong to any period or you have holes between periods results can be unpredictable.

Sales Forecasts configuration
-----------------------------
You have few menus for Sales forecast in "Sales > Sales Forecasts":

 - "Create Sales Forecasts" - can automatically create forecast lines according to your needs
 - "Sales Forecasts" - for managing the Sales forecasts

Menu "Create Sales Forecasts" creates Forecasts for products from selected Category, for selected Period and for selected Warehouse.
It is also possible to copy the previous forecast.

Remarks:

 - This tool doesn't duplicate lines if you already have an entry for the same Product, Period, Warehouse, created or validated by the same user. If you wish to create another forecast, if relevant lines exists you have to do it manually as described below.
 - When created lines are validated by someone else you can use this tool to create another line for the same Period, Product and Warehouse.
 - When you choose "Copy Last Forecast", created line take quantity and other settings from your (validated by you or created by you if not validated yet) forecast which is for last period before period of created forecast.

On "Sales Forecast" form mainly you have to enter a forecast quantity in "Product Quantity".
Further calculation can work for draft forecasts. But validation can save your data against any accidental changes.
You can click "Validate" button but it is not mandatory.

Instead of forecast quantity you may enter the amount of forecast sales via the "Product Amount" field.
The system will count quantity from amount according to Sale price of the Product.

All values on the form are expressed in unit of measure selected on form.
You can select a unit of measure from the default category or from secondary category.
When you change unit of measure the forecast product quantity will be re-computed according to new UoM.

To work out your Sale Forecast you can use the "Sales History" of the product.
You have to enter parameters to the top and left of this table and system will count sale quantities according to these parameters.
So you can get results for a given sales team or period.


MPS or Procurement Planning
---------------------------
An MPS planning consists in Stock Planning lines, used to analyze and possibly drive the procurement of 
products for each relevant Stock Period and Warehouse.
The menu is located in "Warehouse > Schedulers > Master Procurement Schedule":

 - "Create Stock Planning Lines" - a wizard to help automatically create many planning lines
 - "Master Procurement Schedule" - management of your planning lines

Similarly to the way Sales forecast serves to define your sales planning, the MPS lets you plan your procurements (Purchase/Manufacturing).
You can quickly populate the MPS with the "Create Stock Planning Lines" wizard, and then proceed to review them via the "Master Procurement Schedule" menu.

The "Create Stock Planning Lines" wizard lets you to quickly create all MPS lines for a given Product Category, and a given Period and Warehouse.
When you enable the "All Products with Forecast" option of the wizard, the system creates lines for all products having sales forecast for selected
Period and Warehouse (the selected Category will be ignored in this case).

Under menu "Master Procurement Schedule" you will usually change the "Planned Out" and "Planned In" quantities and observe the resulting "Stock Simulation" value
to decide if you need to procure more products for the given Period.
"Planned Out" will be initially based on "Warehouse Forecast" which is the sum of all outgoing stock moves already planned for the Period and Warehouse.
Of course you can alter this value to provide your own quantities. It is not necessary to have any forecast.
"Planned In" quantity is used to calculate field "Incoming Left" which is the quantity to be procured to reach the "Stock Simulation" at the end of Period.
You can compare "Stock Simulation" quantity to minimum stock rules visible on the form.
And you can plan different quantity than in Minimum Stock Rules. Calculations are done for whole Warehouse by default,
if you want to see values for Stock location of calculated warehouse you can check "Stock Location Only".

When you are satisfied with the "Planned Out", "Planned In" and end of period "Stock Simulation",
you can click on "Procure Incoming Left" to create a procurement for the "Incoming Left" quantity.
You can decide if procurement will go to the to Stock or Input location of the Warehouse.

If you don't want to Produce or Buy the product but just transfer the calculated quantity from another warehouse
you can click "Supply from Another Warehouse" (instead of "Procure Incoming Left") and the system will
create the appropriate picking list (stock moves).
You can choose to take the goods from the Stock or the Output location of the source warehouse.
Destination location (Stock or Input) in the destination warehouse will be taken as for the procurement case.

To see update the quantities of "Confirmed In", "Confirmed Out", "Confirmed In Before", "Planned Out Before"
and "Stock Simulation" you can press "Calculate Planning".

All values on the form are expressed in unit of measure selected on form.
You can select one of unit of measure from default category or from secondary category.
When you change unit of measure the editable quantities will be re-computed according to new UoM. The others will be updated after pressing "Calculate Planning".

Computation of Stock Simulation quantities
------------------------------------------
The Stock Simulation value is the estimated stock quantity at the end of the period.
The calculation always starts with the real stock on hand at the beginning of the current period, then
adds or subtracts the computed quantities.
When you are in the same period (current period is the same as calculated) Stock Simulation is calculated as follows:

Stock Simulation =
	Stock of beginning of current Period
	- Planned Out
	+ Planned In

When you calculate period next to current:

Stock Simulation =
	Stock of beginning of current Period
	- Planned Out of current Period
	+ Confirmed In of current Period  (incl. Already In)
	- Planned Out of calculated Period
	+ Planned In of calculated Period .

As you see the calculated Period is taken the same way as in previous case, but the calculation in the current
Period is a little bit different. First you should note that system takes for only Confirmed moves for the
current period. This means that you should complete the planning and procurement of the current Period before
going to the next one.

When you plan for future Periods:

Stock Simulation =
	Stock of beginning of current Period
	- Sum of Planned Out of Periods before calculated
	+ Sum of Confirmed In of Periods before calculated (incl. Already In)
	- Planned Out of calculated Period
	+ Planned In of calculated Period.

Here "Periods before calculated" designates all periods starting with the current until the period before the one being calculated.

Remarks:

 - Remember to make the proceed with the planning of each period in chronological order, otherwise the numbers will not reflect the
   reality
 - If you planned for future periods and find that real Confirmed Out is larger than Planned Out in some periods before,
   you can repeat Planning and make another procurement. You should do it in the same planning line.
   If you create another planning line the suggestions can be wrong.
 - When you wish to work with different periods for some products, define two kinds of periods (e.g. Weekly and Monthly) and use
   them for different products. Example: If you use always Weekly periods for Product A, and Monthly periods for Product B
   all calculations will work correctly. You can also use different kind of periods for the same product from different warehouse
   or companies. But you cannot use overlapping periods for the same product, warehouse and company because results
   can be unpredictable. The same applies to Forecasts lines.

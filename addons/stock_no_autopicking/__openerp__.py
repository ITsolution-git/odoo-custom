    'description': """
    This module allows an intermediate picking process to provide raw materials
    to production orders.

    One example of usage of this module is to manage production made by your
    suppliers (sub-contracting). To achieve this, set the assembled product
    which is sub-contracted to "No Auto-Picking" and put the location of the
    supplier in the routing of the assembly operation.

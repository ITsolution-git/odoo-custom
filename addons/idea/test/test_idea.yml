  In order to test the Idea module in OpenERP,
-
  I open the idea "Need to put a good idea on OpenERP".
-
  !workflow {model: idea.idea, action: idea_open, ref: idea_idea_one}
-
  I check that the idea's state is open.
-
  !assert {model: idea.idea, id: idea_idea_one}:
    - state == 'open'
-
  I give vote the idea as "Very Good" and put comment "It will good for openERP feature".
-
  !python {model: idea.post.vote}: |
    new_id = self.create(cr, uid, {'vote': "100", 'note': 'It will good for openERP feature'}, {"active_ids": [ref("idea_idea_one")]})
    self.do_vote(cr, uid, [new_id], {'active_ids': [ref('idea_idea_one')]})
-
  I check the Average score.
-
  !assert {model: idea.idea, id: idea_idea_one}:
    vote_avg: 100
-
  I Accept the idea of "Need to put a good idea on OpenERP".
-
  !workflow {model: idea.idea, action: idea_close, ref: idea_idea_one}
-
  I check that the idea's state is now Accepted.
-
  !assert {model: idea.idea, id: idea_idea_one}:
    - state == 'close'
-
  I Refuse the idea of "Technical  presentation for 1 hours in every day".
-
  !workflow {model: idea.idea, action: idea_open, ref: idea_idea_two}
-
  !workflow {model: idea.idea, action: idea_cancel, ref: idea_idea_two}
-
  I check that the idea's state is now Refused.
-
  !assert {model: idea.idea, id: idea_idea_two}:
    - state == 'cancel'

* Bar code supported
* Rapid detection of mistakes through double entry system
* Traceability (upstream/downstream, production lots, serial number, ...)
* Dashboard for warehouse that includes:
    * Products to receive in delay (date < = today)
    * Procurement in exception
    * Graph : Number of Receive products vs planned (bar graph on week par day)
    * Graph : Number of Delivery products vs planned (bar graph on week par day)

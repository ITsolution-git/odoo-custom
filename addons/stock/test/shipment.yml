  I confirm incomming shipment of 50 kgm Ice-cream.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
      self.action_confirm(cr, uid, [ref("incomming_shipment")])
-
  I receive 40kgm Ice-cream so It will make backorder of incomming shipment for 10 kgm.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    pick = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("incomming_shipment"), context=context)
    self.pool.get('stock.pack.operation').create(cr, uid, {
        'picking_id': pick.id,
        'product_id': ref('product_icecream'),
        'product_uom_id': ref('product.product_uom_kgm'),
        'product_qty': 40
    })
    context.update({'active_model': 'stock.picking', 'active_id': ref('incomming_shipment'), 'active_ids': [ref('incomming_shipment')]})
    pick.do_partial(context=context)
-
  I check backorder shipment after received partial shipment and check remaining shipment.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    shipment = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("incomming_shipment"))
    for move_line in shipment.move_lines:
        assert move_line.product_qty == 40, "Qty in shipment does not correspond."
        assert move_line.state == 'done', "Move line of shipment should be closed."
    backorder_id = self.search(cr, uid, [('backorder_id', '=', ref("incomming_shipment"))],context=context)
    backorder = self.browse(cr, uid, backorder_id)[0]
    for move_line in backorder.move_lines:
        assert move_line.product_qty == 10, "Qty in backorder does not correspond."
        assert (move_line.state == 'assigned' or move_line.state == 'waiting' or move_line.state == 'confirmed'), "Move line of backorder should be assigned, confirmed or waiting."
    context.update({'active_model': 'stock.picking', 'active_id': backorder_id[0], 'active_ids': backorder_id})
-
  I receive the remaining 10kgm Ice-cream from the backorder.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    backorder_id = self.search(cr, uid, [('backorder_id', '=', ref("incomming_shipment"))],context=context)
    backorder = self.browse(cr, uid, backorder_id)[0]
    self.pool.get('stock.pack.operation').create(cr, uid, {
        'picking_id': backorder.id,
        'product_id': ref('product_icecream'),
        'product_uom_id': ref('product.product_uom_kgm'),
        'product_qty': 10
    })
    backorder.do_partial(context=context)
-
  I check incomming shipment after reception.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    shipment = self.browse(cr, uid, self.search(cr, uid, [('backorder_id', '=', ref("incomming_shipment"))]))[0]
    assert shipment.state == 'done', "shipment should be close after received."
    for move_line in shipment.move_lines:
        assert move_line.state == 'done', "Move line should be closed."

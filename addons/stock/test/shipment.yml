  I confirm outgoing shipment of 130 kgm Ice-cream.
-
  !workflow {model: stock.picking, action: button_confirm, ref: outgoing_shipment}
-
  I check shipment details after confirmed.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    shipment = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("outgoing_shipment"))
    assert shipment.state == "confirmed", "Shipment should be confirmed."
    for move_line in shipment.move_lines:
        assert move_line.state == "confirmed", "Move should be confirmed."

-
  Now I check vitual stock of Ice-cream after confirmed outgoing shipment.
-
  !python {model: product.product}: |
    product = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('product_icecream'), context=context)
    product.virtual_available == -30, "Vitual stock is not updated."

-
  I confirm incomming shipment of 50 kgm Ice-cream.
-
  !workflow {model: stock.picking, action: button_confirm, ref: incomming_shipment}
-
  I receive 40kgm Ice-cream so I make backorder of incomming shipment for 40 kgm.
-
  !python {model: stock.partial.picking}: |
    context.update({'active_model': 'stock.picking', 'active_id': ref('incomming_shipment'), 'active_ids': [ref('incomming_shipment')]})
-
  !record {model: stock.partial.picking, id: partial_incomming}:
    move_ids:
        - quantity: 40
          product_id: product_icecream
          product_uom: product.product_uom_kgm
          move_id: incomming_shipment_icecream
          location_id: location_convenience_shop
          location_dest_id: location_refrigerator
-
  !python {model: stock.partial.picking }: |
    self.do_partial(cr, uid, [ref('partial_incomming')], context=context)
-
  I check backorder shipment after received partial shipment.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    shipment = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("incomming_shipment"))
    backorder = shipment.backorder_id
    assert backorder, "Backorder should be created after partial shipment."
    assert backorder.state == 'done', "Backorder should be close after received."
    for move_line in backorder.move_lines:
        assert move_line.product_qty == 40, "Qty in backorder does not correspond."
        assert move_line.state == 'done', "Move line of backorder should be closed."
-
  I receive another 10kgm Ice-cream.
-
  !record {model: stock.partial.picking, id: partial_incomming}:
    move_ids:
        - quantity: 10
          product_id: product_icecream
          product_uom: product.product_uom_kgm
          move_id: incomming_shipment_icecream
          location_id: location_convenience_shop
          location_dest_id: location_refrigerator
-
  !python {model: stock.partial.picking }: |
    self.do_partial(cr, uid, [ref('partial_incomming')], context=context)

-
  I check incomming shipment after received.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    shipment = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("incomming_shipment"))
    assert shipment.state == 'done', "shipment should be close after received."
    for move_line in shipment.move_lines:
        assert move_line.product_qty == 10, "Qty does not correspond."
        assert move_line.product_id.virtual_available == 20, "Virtual stock does not correspond."
        assert move_line.state == 'done', "Move line should be closed."

-
  I return last incomming shipment for 10 kgm Ice-cream.
-
  !record {model: stock.return.picking, id: return_incomming}:
    invoice_state: none
-
  !python {model: stock.return.picking }: |
    # this work without giving the id of the picking to return, magically, thanks to the context
    self.create_returns(cr, uid, [ref('return_incomming')], context=context)
-
  I cancel incomming shipment after return it.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    # the cancel is not on the return, but on the incomming shipment (which now has a quantity of 10, thanks to the 
    # backorder). This situation is a little weird as we returned a move that we finally cancelled... As result, only
    # 30Kg from the original 50Kg will be counted in the stock (50 - 10 (cancelled quantity) - 10 (returned quantity))
    self.action_cancel(cr, uid, [ref("incomming_shipment")], context=context)
-
  I make invoice of backorder of incomming shipment.
-
  !python {model: stock.invoice.onshipping}: |
    shipment = self.pool.get('stock.picking').browse(cr, uid, ref("incomming_shipment"))
    context.update({'active_model': 'stock.picking', 'active_id': shipment.backorder_id.id, 'active_ids': [shipment.backorder_id.id]})
-
  I check available stock after received incomming shipping. (removed invoicing here)
-
  !python {model: product.product}: |
    product = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('product_icecream'), context=context)
    assert product.qty_available == 140, "Stock does not correspond."
    assert product.virtual_available == 0, "Vitual stock does not correspond."

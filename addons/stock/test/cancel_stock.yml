  In order to test the cancel process in stock, I test by cancelling the delivery order.
-
  I create two delivery orders to check cancel process with two different ways.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    stock = self.pool.get('stock.move')
    context.update({'active_id':ref('stock.stock_picking_1')})
    id1 = self.copy(cr, uid, ref('stock.stock_picking_1'), context)
    id2 = self.copy(cr, uid, ref('stock.stock_picking_1'), context)
    context.update({'id1': id1,'id2': id2})
-
  I cancel a delivery order which is in draft state.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    import netsvc
    wf_service = netsvc.LocalService("workflow")
    pick_id = context.get('id2')
    self.cancel_assign(cr, uid, [pick_id])
    picking = self.browse(cr, uid, pick_id, context=context)
    wf_service.trg_validate(uid, 'stock.picking', pick_id, 'button_cancel', cr)
    assert picking.state == 'cancel',"Delivery order should be cancelled."
-
  Now, I cancel all related stock moves of another delivery order so automatically delivery order goes to cancelled state.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    import netsvc
    wf_service = netsvc.LocalService("workflow")
    move_obj = self.pool.get('stock.move')
    picking = self.browse(cr, uid, context.get('id1'))
    move_ids = move_obj.search(cr, uid, [('picking_id','=',picking.id)])
    move_obj.action_confirm(cr, uid, move_ids)
    move_obj.force_assign(cr, uid, move_ids)
    move_obj.action_cancel(cr, uid, move_ids)
    assert picking.state == 'cancel',"Delivery order should be cancelled."

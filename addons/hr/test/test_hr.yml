  In order to test the hr module in OpenERP, I will create new Employee , Department and Job Position.
-
  |
  First I create Department  "R & D" in Department form.
- 
  !record {model: hr.department, id: hr_department_rd0}:
    manager_id: base.user_root
    name: 'R & D '
-     
  |
  Now, I  create a new employee “employee1”.
  select "R & D" Department  which I had created.    
-
  !record {model: hr.employee, id: hr_employee_employee0}:
    address_home_id: base.res_partner_address_1
    company_id: base.main_company
    gender: male
    marital: hr.hr_employee_marital_status_single
    name: employee1
    user_id: base.user_root
    department_id: 'hr_department_rd0'

- |
  In order to check the wizard “Employee Hierarchy” I will create new employee “employee2” and select "employee1" as 
  Manager.    
- 
  !record {model: hr.employee, id: hr_employee_employee1}:
    address_home_id: base.res_partner_address_3000
    company_id: base.main_company
    gender: male
    name: employee2
    user_id: base.user_demo
    parent_id: 'hr_employee_employee0'
- |
  Now I will open up form view of  “employee1” and test the wizard “Employee Hierarchy” so it display the employee
  hierarchy starting from “employee1”. 
       
- |
  Now I will create new Job Position. I will check successfull creation of new Job Position by adding the information.
- 
  !record {model: hr.job, id: hr_job_jea0}:
    department_id: 'hr_department_rd0'
    description: 'Position of Junier Application Engineer '
    expected_employees: 5
    name: 'JEA '
- |
  I check that Employee form is in "Open" state.
-
  !assert {model: hr.job, id: hr_job_jea0}:
    - state == 'open'  
    
- |
  I create Employee for this position in this Job Position form.
- 
  !record {model: hr.job, id: hr_job_jea0}:
    employee_ids:
      - address_home_id: base.res_partner_address_1
        name: employee3 
        department_id: 'hr_department_rd0'
        gender: male
        parent_id: 'hr_employee_employee0'
-
  I check that "NO of Employee" is "1"     
-
  !assert {model: hr.job, id: hr_job_jea0}:
    - no_of_employee != False

    import addons
    request_file = open(addons.get_module_resource('crm_fundraising','test', 'customer_fundraising.eml'),'rb')
    request_message = request_file.read()
    self.message_process(cr, uid, 'crm.fundraising', request_message)

  After getting the mail, I check details of new fundraising of that customer.

  !python {model: crm.fundraising}: |
    from openerp import tools
    fund_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('email_from','=', 'Mr. John Right <info@customer.com>')])
    assert fund_ids and len(fund_ids), "Fund is not created after getting request"
    fund = self.browse(cr, uid, fund_ids[0], context=context)
    assert fund.name == tools.ustr("Demande de controbute dans votre fonds."), "Subject does not match"

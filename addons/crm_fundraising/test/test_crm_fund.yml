  Now I start test Fund Raising  which contain information about Donation or charity 
  given by user.

  I start by creating new Funds entry for donation for books to poor school children 
  with cost 500000.00 and category as "Learning And Education"
  I make payment by Cheque so I make sure that the mode on fund is selected as cheque

  !record {model: crm.fundraising, id: crm_fundraising_donationforbookstopoorschoolchildren0}:
    categ_id: crm_fundraising.categ_fund2
    email_from: info@balmerinc.be
    name: Donation for books to poor school children
    partner_address_id: base.res_partner_address_1
    partner_id: base.res_partner_9
    planned_cost: 500000.0
    section_id: crm.section_sales_department
    type_id: crm_fundraising.type_fund2

  I check that the Funds  is in 'draft' state.
-
  !assert {model: crm.fundraising, id: crm_fundraising_donationforbookstopoorschoolchildren0}:
    - state == 'draft'
- |
  Now I open Funds by click on "Open" button

  !python {model: crm.fundraising}: |
    self.case_open(cr, uid, [ref('crm_fundraising_donationforbookstopoorschoolchildren0')])

  I can close Funds by click on "Done" button.

  !python {model: crm.fundraising}: |
    self.case_close(cr, uid, [ref('crm_fundraising_donationforbookstopoorschoolchildren0')])

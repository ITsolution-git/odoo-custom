========================================================

If you get an error for the installation of the plugin, edit the pythonloader.py file
in $(OPEN_OFFICE_DIR)\program\ and change the value of DEBUG to None.

If you get an error for the uno.exe in window then just close the Quick starter
	Openoffice.2.4.1 Too\Option\Openoffic.org in that select the Memory
	in that Openoffice.org.QuickStarter
	if checked mark is there then just remove it..

If you are using OpenOffice 3.0 and install the Report Desinger with make all
	command then change  path in makefile

	sh /opt/openoffice.org3/program/unopkg add or remove both

	And for previous version of Openoffice used

	sh /usr/lib/openoffice/program/unopkg add -v $(ZIP_FILE)

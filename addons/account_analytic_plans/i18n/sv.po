msgid "This module allows to use several analytic plans, according to the general journal,\n"
"so that multiple analytic lines are created when the invoice or the entries\n"
"are confirmed.\n"
"\n"
"For example, you can define the following analytic structure:\n"
"  Projects\n"
"      Project 1\n"
"          SubProj 1.1\n"
"          SubProj 1.2\n"
"      Project 2\n"
"  Salesman\n"
"      Eric\n"
"      Fabien\n"
"\n"
"Here, we have two plans: Projects and Salesman. An invoice line must\n"
"be able to write analytic entries in the 2 plans: SubProj 1.1 and\n"
"Fabien. The amount can also be split. The following example is for\n"
"an invoice that touches the two subproject and assigned to one salesman:\n"
"\n"
"Plan1:\n"
"    SubProject 1.1 : 50%\n"
"    SubProject 1.2 : 50%\n"
"Plan2:\n"
"    Eric: 100%\n"
"\n"
"So when this line of invoice will be confirmed, it will generate 3 analytic lines,\n"
"for one account entry.\n"

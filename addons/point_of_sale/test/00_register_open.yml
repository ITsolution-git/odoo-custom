  In order to test the Point of Sale module, I will open all cash registers through the wizard
-
  I go to the window to open the cash registers as admin
-
  !record {model: pos.open.statement, id: new_statement_open}:
- 
  I click on the button to open all statements/cash registers
- 
  !python {model: pos.open.statement}: |
    self.open_statement(cr, uid, [ref('new_statement_open')], context={})
- 
  I check that I have some bank statements open for the admin user
- 
  !python {model: account.bank.statement}: |
    ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('state', 'in', ('open','new')), ('user_id', '=', 1)])
    assert (len(ids)>0), 'No statement open for the admin user!'

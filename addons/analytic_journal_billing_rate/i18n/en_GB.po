"a specific journal on a given account. This is mostly used when a user "
"encodes his timesheet: the values are retrieved and the fields are auto-"
"filled... but the possibility to change these values is still available.\n"

"    Obviously if no data has been recorded for the current account, the "
"default value is given as usual by the account data so that this module is "

    "description": """This module replaces the cleartext password in the database with a password hash,
preventing anyone from reading the original password.
For your existing user base, the removal of the cleartext passwords occurs the first time
a user logs into the database, after installing base_crypt.
After installing this module it won't be possible to recover a forgotten password for your
users, the only solution is for an admin to set a new password.

Note: installing this module does not mean you can ignore basic security measures,
as the password is still transmitted unencrypted on the network (by the client),
unless you are using a secure protocol such as XML-RPCS.

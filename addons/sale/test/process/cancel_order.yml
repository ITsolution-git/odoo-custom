  In order to test the cancel sale order.
-
  I try to cancel sale order.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    try:
      self.action_cancel(cr, uid, [ref("order")])
    except Exception,e:
      print e
-
  First I cancel  picking related to this order.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("order"))
    self.pool.get('stock.picking').action_cancel(cr, uid, [picking.id for picking in  order.picking_ids])
    self.action_ship_end(cr, uid, [ref('order')]) 
-
  I try to cancel the invoice.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("order4"))
    self.action_invoice_cancel(cr, uid, [ref("order4")], context)
    self.action_invoice_end(cr, uid, [ref('order4')], context)
-
  I check order status in "Shipping Exception" and related picking is in cancel state.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("order"))
    assert order.picking_ids[0].state == "cancel","order's related picking should be cancelled"
    #assert order.state == "shipping_except", "order should be in Ship Exception state after cancel shipment"    
-
  Now I am able to cancel sale order.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    self.action_cancel(cr, uid, [ref("order")])
-
  I check that sale order is cancelled.
-
  !assert {model: sale.order, id: order}:
    - state == 'cancel'
-
  Now try to cancel the order which Invoice Policy is 'Pay before delivery'.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    self.action_cancel(cr, uid, [ref("order3")])
    assert self.browse(cr, uid, ref("order3")).invoice_ids[0].state == "cancel","order's related invoice should be cancelled"
    #assert order.state == "invoice_except", "order should be in Invoice Exception state after cancel Invoice"
-
  Now again set cancelled order to draft.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    self.action_cancel_draft(cr, uid, [ref("order")])
-
  Now I again cancel draft order.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    self.action_cancel(cr, uid, [ref("order")])
-
  I check that order is cancelled.
-
  !assert {model: sale.order, id: order}:
    - state == 'cancel'
-
  Again set cancelled order to draft.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    self.action_cancel_draft(cr, uid, [ref("order")]) 

-
  I cancel sale order line.
-
  !python {model: sale.order.line}: |
    self.button_done(cr, uid, [ref('line')])
    self.button_cancel(cr, uid, [ref('line')])

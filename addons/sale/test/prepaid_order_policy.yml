  Now I confirm the Quotation with "Pay before delivery" policy.
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: order3}
-
  I check that delivery order should not created before invoice is paid.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    sale_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("order3"))
    assert len(sale_order.picking_ids) == False, "Delivery order should not created before invoice."
    assert sale_order.invoice_ids, "Invoice should be created."

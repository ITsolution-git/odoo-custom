    'name': 'Human Resources Expenses Tracking',
    'version': '1.0',
    'category': 'Generic Modules/Human Resources',
    'description': """
    This module aims to manage employee's expenses.

    The whole workflow is implemented:
    * Draft expense
    * Confirmation of the sheet by the employee
    * Validation by his manager
    * Validation by the accountant and invoice creation
    * Payment of the invoice to the employee

    This module also uses the analytic accounting and is compatible with
    the invoice on timesheet module so that you will be able to automatically
    re-invoice your customer's expenses if your work by project.

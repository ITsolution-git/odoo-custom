  In order to test the process of "Employee Expenses" by processing the expenses, I confirm Expense Bill of an employee for September month. 
-
  !workflow {model: hr.expense.expense, action: confirm, ref: sep_expenses}
-
  I check that state is 'Confirm'.
-
  !assert {model: hr.expense.expense, id: sep_expenses, severity: error, string: Expense should be in Confirm state}:
    - state == 'confirm'
-
  I approve the September expenses.
-
  !workflow {model: hr.expense.expense, action: validate, ref: sep_expenses}
-
  I check that state is 'Approved'
-
  !assert {model: hr.expense.expense, id: sep_expenses, severity: error, string: Expense should be in Approved state}:
    - state == 'accepted'
-
  I make Invoice for the expense.
-
  !python {model: hr.expense.expense}: |
    self.invoice(cr, uid, [ref('sep_expenses')])
-
  I check invoice details.
-
  !python {model: hr.expense.expense}: |
    sep_expenses = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("sep_expenses"), context=context)
    assert sep_expenses.state == 'invoiced', "Expense should be in 'Invoiced' state."
    assert sep_expenses.invoice_id, "Expense should have link of Invoice."
    assert sep_expenses.invoice_id.currency_id == sep_expenses.currency_id,"Invoice currency is not correspond with supplier invoice currency"
    assert sep_expenses.invoice_id.origin == sep_expenses.name,"Invoice origin is not correspond with supplier invoice"
    assert sep_expenses.invoice_id.type == 'in_invoice', "Invoice type is not supplier invoice"
    assert sep_expenses.invoice_id.amount_total == sep_expenses.amount,"Invoice total amount is not correspond with supplier invoice total"
    assert len(sep_expenses.invoice_id.invoice_line) == len(sep_expenses.line_ids),"Lines of Invoice and supplier invoice Line are not correspond"
    #TODO: check invoice line details with Expenses lines
-
  I pay the expenses.
-
  !python {model: hr.expense.expense}: |
    self.expense_paid(cr, uid, [ref('sep_expenses')])
-
  I check that state of expenses is 'Paid'.
-
  !assert {model: hr.expense.expense, id: sep_expenses, severity: error, string: Expense should be in Paid state}:
    - state == 'paid'
-
  I duplicate the expenses and cancel duplicated.
-
  !python {model: hr.expense.expense}: |
    duplicate_id = self.copy(cr, uid, ref('sep_expenses'), context=context)
    self.expense_canceled(cr, uid, [duplicate_id])
-
  I print a report of the expenses.
- 
  !python {model: hr.expense.expense}: |
    import netsvc, tools, os
    (data, format) = netsvc.LocalService('report.hr.expense').create(cr, uid, [ref('hr_expense.sep_expenses')], {}, {})
    if tools.config['test_report_directory']:
        file(os.path.join(tools.config['test_report_directory'], 'hr_expense-report.'+format), 'wb+').write(data)

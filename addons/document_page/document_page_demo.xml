You like OpenERP, but feel like you want to personalise it more? Now, OpenERP
goes a step further and lets you customize your dashboard.  Thanks to a new
feature that allows you to customize your dashboard by adding new boards of any
search view.

==How is it done?==

Step 1: access one search view 

Step 2: apply the filter you want to see at each connection to the application
(eg. on sales, manufacturing, etc)

Step 3: add it into the dashboard in the same space where you can save the filter

Step 4: choose the application you want it visible on and the name of the array

Look at this simple example below from Purchase, where I want to put on the
application's dashboard "Purchases to Approve". After I access the search view
and apply the filter for "Purchases to Approve", I can add it immediately to my
Purchase dashboard.

In less than a minute, the search view is visible on the dashboard

Of course, you are free to delete what you don't need or like, but just in case
you change your mind there is a reset button to return to the default view.

have to install or deploy any software and all the sales shops can be easily
consolidated.  It works in connected and disconnected modes so that you can
continue to sell if you lose your internet connection.

You have different options to select your products. You can do it through the
barcode reader, just browse through the categories you have put in place (ie.

the application allows multiple payment methods.

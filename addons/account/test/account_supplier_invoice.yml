  In order to test account invoice I create a new supplier invoice
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier0}:
    account_id: account.a_pay
    address_contact_id: base.res_partner_address_3000
    address_invoice_id: base.res_partner_address_3000
    check_total: 3000.0
    company_id: base.main_company
    currency_id: base.EUR
    invoice_line:
      - account_id: account.a_expense
        name: '[PC1] Basic PC'
        price_unit: 300.0
        product_id: product.product_product_pc1
        quantity: 10.0
        uos_id: product.product_uom_unit
    journal_id: account.expenses_journal
    partner_id: base.res_partner_desertic_hispafuentes
    reference_type: none
    type: in_invoice
-
  I check that Initially supplier invoice state is "Draft"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier0}:
    - state == 'draft'
-
  I change the state of invoice to open by clicking Validate button
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: account_invoice_supplier0}
-
  I check that the invoice state is now "Open"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier0}:
    - state == 'open'

"This module supplements the Warehouse application by adding support for per-product\n"
"location paths, effectively implementing Push and Pull inventory flows.\n"
"\n"
"Typically this could be used to:\n"
"* Manage product manufacturing chains\n"
"* Manage default locations per product\n"
"* Define routes within your warehouse according to business needs, such as:\n"
"   - Quality Control\n"
"   - After Sales Services\n"
"   - Supplier Returns\n"
"* Help rental management, by generating automated return moves for rented products\n"
"\n"
"Once this module is installed, an additional tab appear on the product form, where you can add\n"
"Push and Pull flow specifications. The demo data of  CPU1 product for that push/pull :\n"
"\n"
"Push flows\n"
"----------\n"
"Push flows are useful when the arrival of certain products in a given location should always\n"
"be followed by a corresponding move to another location, optionally after a certain delay.\n"
"The original Warehouse application already supports such Push flow specifications on the\n"
"Locations themselves, but these cannot be refined per-product.\n"
"\n"
"A push flow specification indicates which location is chained with which location, and with\n"
"what parameters. As soon as a given quantity of products is moved in the source location,\n"
"a chained move is automatically foreseen according to the parameters set on the flow specification\n"
"(destination location, delay, type of move, journal, etc.) The new move can be automatically\n"
"processed, or require a manual confirmation, depending on the parameters.\n"
"\n"
"Pull flows\n"
"----------\n"
"Pull flows are a bit different from Pull flows, in the sense that they are not related to\n"
"the processing of product moves, but rather to the processing of procurement orders.\n"
"What is being pulled is a need, not directly products.\n"
"A classical example of Push flow is when you have an Outlet company, with a parent Company\n"
"that is responsible for the supplies of the Outlet.\n"
"\n"
"  [ Customer ] <- A - [ Outlet ]  <- B -  [ Holding ] <~ C ~ [ Supplier ]\n"
"\n"
"When a new procurement order (A, coming from the confirmation of a Sale Order for example) arrives\n"
"in the Outlet, it is converted into another procurement (B, via a Push flow of type 'move')\n"
"requested from the Holding. When procurement order B is processed by the Holding company, and\n"
"if the product is out of stock, it can be converted into a Purchase Order (C) from the Supplier\n"
"(Push flow of type Purchase). The result is that the procurement order, the need, is pushed\n"
"all the way between the Customer and Supplier.\n"
"\n"
"Technically, Pull flows allow to process procurement orders differently, not only depending on\n"
"the product being considered, but also depending on which location holds the \"need\" for that\n"
"product (i.e. the destination location of that procurement order).\n"
"\n"
"Use-Case\n"
"--------\n"
"\n"
"You can use the demo data as follow:\n"
"  CPU1: Sell some CPU1 from Shop 1 and run the scheduler\n"
"     - Warehouse: delivery order, Shop 1: reception\n"
"  CPU3:\n"
"     - When receiving the product, it goes to Quality Control location then stored to shelf 2.\n"
"     - When delivering the customer: Pick List -> Packing -> Delivery Order from Gate A\n"
"    "

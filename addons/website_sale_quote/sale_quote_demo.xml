                                        The SoundLink® Mini speaker is small and light enough
                                        to tuck into your bag. It weighs in at just 1.5 pounds.
                                        Its low profile lets you place it almost anywhere and
                                        provides a low center of gravity that makes it nearly
                                        impossible to tip over.
                                </p>

                                    The rechargeable lithium-ion battery delivers up to seven hours of playtime.
                                    And at home, you can listen even longer—the charging cradle lets
                                    you listen while it charges.

                                    And it remembers the most recent six devices you've used,
                                    so reconnecting is even simpler.

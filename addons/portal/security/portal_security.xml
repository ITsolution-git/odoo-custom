Members of this groups have access to the portal definitions, and can easily manage the users, access right and menus of portal users.
Members of this group who are also members of the Sharing/User group get additional options in the sharing wizard:
 - they may select a list of existing users to share with, without having to give a list of emails
 - they may choose to share with a Portal group instead of sharing with users, effectively extending the Portal content
These features are useful for setting up Portals, but this could result in an alteration of the system's security policy.
Therefore this should be granted only to trustworthy users who know the security policy very well.
This group must not be deleted.</field>

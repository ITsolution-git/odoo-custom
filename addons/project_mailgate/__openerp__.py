This module can automatically create Project Tasks based on incoming emails
===========================================================================

Allows creating tasks based on new emails arriving at a given mailbox,
similarly to what the CRM application has for Leads/Opportunities.
There are two common alternatives to configure the mailbox integration:

 * Install the ``fetchmail`` module and configure a new mailbox, then select
   ``Project Tasks`` as the target for incoming emails.
 * Set it up manually on your mail server based on the 'mail gateway' script
   provided in the ``mail`` module - and connect it to the `project.task` model.

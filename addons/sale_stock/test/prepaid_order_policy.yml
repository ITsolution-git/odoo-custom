  Now I confirm the Quotation with "Pay before delivery" policy with access rights of salesman.
-
  !context
    uid: 'res_sale_stock_salesman'
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: sale.sale_order_4}
-
  I check that delivery order should not created before invoice is paid.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    sale_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("sale.sale_order_4"))
    assert len(sale_order.picking_ids) == False, "Delivery order should not created before invoice."
    assert sale_order.invoice_ids, "Invoice should be created."

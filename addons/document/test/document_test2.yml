    In order to test the document management
-
    I make sure the default installation has some storage and root directory.
-
    !assert {model: document.storage, id: storage_default }:
      - id != False
-
    !assert {model: document.directory, id: dir_root}:
      - storage_id != False
-
    I create a "Testing" folder where all the test data will go.
-
    !record {model: document.directory, id: dir_tests }:
        name: 'Testing'
        parent_id: dir_root
-
    I create an attachment into the root folder (w. empty fields, test that
    defaults work)
-
    I delete the attachment from the root folder
-
    I create an attachment into the Testing folder.
-
    I update the attachment with data, namely "abcd"
-
    I rename the attachment.
-
    I search the testing folder for attachments.
-
    I create an attachment to a 3rd resource, eg. a res.country
-
    I search for the res.country attachment

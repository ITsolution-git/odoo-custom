    'description': """
    This module allows Just In Time computation of procurement orders.

    If you install this module, you will not have to run the procurement scheduler
    manually anymore, or wait for it to execute.
    Each procurement order (resulting from a sale order, for instance) will be computed 
    when confirmed, without waiting for the procurement scheduler to run.
    
    Warning: this does not take into account minimum stock rules (order points), which still 
    require to run the appropriate scheduler, or wait for it to run nightly.
     
    Note that the procurement computation can be resource-intensive, so you may 
    want to be careful with this, depending on your mrp configuration and system 
    usage.
    It may also increase your stock size because products are reserved as soon
    as possible. In that case, you can not use priorities any more.

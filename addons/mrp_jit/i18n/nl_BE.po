"    This module allows Just In Time computation of procurement orders.\n"
"\n"
"    If you install this module, you will not have to run the regular procurement \n"
"    scheduler anymore (but you still need to run the minimum order point rule \n"
"    scheduler, or for example let it run daily.)\n"
"    All procurement orders will be processed immediately, which could in some\n"
"    cases entail a small performance impact.\n"
"\n"
"    It may also increase your stock size because products are reserved as soon\n"
"    as possible and the scheduler time range is not taken into account anymore. \n"
"    In that case, you can not use priorities any more on the different picking.\n"

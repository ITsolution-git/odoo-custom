OpenERP Quick Installation Guide
---------------------------------

This file contains a quick guide to configure and install the OpenERP server.

Required dependencies:
---------------------

You need the following software installed:

    * Python 2.5 or 2.6
    * Postgresql 8.2 or above
    * Psycopg2 python module 
    * Reportlab pdf generation library for python
    * lxml python module
    * pytz python module
    * PyYaml python module (install with: easy_install PyYaml)

Some dependencies are only required for specific purposes:

for rendering workflows graphs, you need:
    * graphviz
    * pyparsing

For Luxembourg localization, you also need:
    * pdftk (http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/)

for generating reports using non .jpg images, you need:
    * Python Imaging Library for python

For Debian-based distributions, the required packages can be installed with the 
following command:

  #> apt-get install -y postgresql graphviz python-psycopg2 python-lxml python-tz python-imaging

For Fedora 
if they are not installed, install:
python and postgresql

uses yum or you can recover required packages on fedora web site in "core" or "extra" repository :
postgresql-python
python-lxml
python-imaging
python-psycopg2
python-reportlab
graphviz
You can find pyparsing at http://pyparsing.sourceforge.net/ 

1. Check that all the required dependencies are installed.

2. Launch the program "python ./bin/openerp-server.py -r db_user -w db_password --db_host 127.0.0.1".
See the man page for more information about options.

3. Connect to the server using the GUI client. And follow the instructions to create a new database.

Installation Steps
------------------

1. Check that all the required dependencies are installed.

2. Create a postgresql database.

The default database name is "terp". If you want to use another name, you
will need to provide it when launching the server (by using the commandline
option --database).

To create a postgresql database named "terp" using the following command:
    $ createdb --encoding=UNICODE terp

If it is the first time you use postgresql you might need to create a new user
to the postgres system using the following commands (where myusername is your
unix user name):

    $ su -
    # su - postgres
    $ createuser openerp
    Shall the new user be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
    Shall the new user be allowed to create more new users? (y/n) y
    CREATE USER
    $ logout
    # logout

3. Launch service daemon by "service openerp-server start".

The first time it is run, the server will initialise the database with all the default values.

4. Connect to the server using the GUI client.

There are two accounts by default:
    * login: admin, password:admin
    * login: demo, password:demo

Some instructions to use setup.py for a user-install.
This file should/will be moved on a proper documentation place later.


- Possibly clean any left-over of the previous build.
  > rm -rf dist openerp_server.egg-info

- Possibly copy the addons in the server if we want them to be packaged
  together:
  > rsync -av --delete \
    --exclude .bzr/ \
    --exclude .bzrignore \
    --exclude /__init__.py \
    --exclude /base \
    --exclude /base_quality_interrogation.py \
    <path-to-addons> openerp/addons

- Create the user-local directory where we want the package to be installed:
   > mkdir -p /home/openerp/openerp-tmp/lib/python2.6/site-packages/

- Use --prefix to specify where the package is installed and include that
  place in PYTHONPATH:
  > PYTHONPATH=/home/openerp/openerp-tmp/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ \
    python setup.py install --prefix=/home/openerp/openerp-tmp

- Run the main script, again specifying the PYTHONPATH:
  > PYTHONPATH=/home/openerp/openerp-tmp/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ \
    /home/openerp/openerp-tmp/bin/openerp-server

This document describes the steps to follow to migrate from a version 3.3.0 of Tiny ERP server to a version 3.4.0

Warning: the migration scripts involved in this migration are only meant for 
a standard Tiny ERP installation. It might not work or even break some data 
if you added or modified some code to the default Tiny ERP distribution.

To migrate a 3.3.0 server to version 3.4.0 you should:

- stop Tiny ERP server 3.3.0

- backup your database
	For example: pg_dump terp330 > backup330.sql

- run the pre.py script (located in this directory)
	You might need to pass it some optional arguments so that it can connect 
	to the database.

	For example: python pre.py -d terp330

- run TinyERP server 3.4.0 with "-u all" in the parameters
	For example: ./tinyerp-server.py -d terp330 -u all

- stop TinyERP server 3.4.0

- run the post.py script (located in this directory)

	You might need to pass it some optional arguments so that it can connect 
	to the database.

	For example: python post.py -d terp330

- run TinyERP server 3.4.0 again with "-u all" in the parameters
	For example: ./tinyerp-server.py -d terp330 -u all

- you are ready to work with the new version.

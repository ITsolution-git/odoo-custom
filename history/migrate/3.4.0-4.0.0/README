This document describes the steps to follow to migrate from a version 3.4.0 of Tiny ERP server to a version 4.0.0

Warning: the migration scripts involved in this migration are only meant for 
a standard Tiny ERP installation. It might not work or even break some data 
if you added or modified some code to the default Tiny ERP distribution.

To migrate a 3.4.0 server to version 4.0.0 you should:

- stop Tiny ERP server 3.4.0

- backup your database
	For example: pg_dump terp340 > backup340.sql

- run the pre.py script (located in this directory)
	You might need to pass it some optional arguments so that it can connect 
	to the database.

	For example: python pre.py -d terp340

- run TinyERP server 4.0.0 with "-d terp340 -u all" in the parameters
	For example: ./tinyerp-server.py -d terp340 -u all

- stop TinyERP server 4.0.0

- run the post.py script (located in this directory)
	You might need to pass it some optional arguments so that it can connect 
	to the database.

- you are ready to work with the new version.
